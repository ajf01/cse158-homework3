       "  'text': '=EARLY ACCESS REVIEW=\\n*Klunky but fun*\\nIn a nutshell, \"Pain the Town Red\" is a first person Voxel chaos brawler that plays like a cross between the Royal Rumble and Mortal Kombat.\\nThere are no alliances.  Enemies will only chase you so far before they decide they\\'d rather beat the snot out of the nearest person.  This includes the bosses, who may find themselves mobbed by the mobs.\\nMost things can be picked up and swung, jabbed or thrown at your enemies.  You\\'re given a few moments to get a feel for the map and then regardless if you start the fight or not, eventually everyone will go crazy.  Certain bosses will not be hostile until enough of the normal thugs are dead (and you can use this to your advantage) but they will eventually come for you.\\nGame play wise, it\\'s deceptively difficult.  While the enemies are as stupid as the day is long and you are far, far more agile with many more abilities, you can\\'t take many hits -- the player seems only as sturdy as a normal enemy.  If a weapon kills an enemy in short order, you can bet it will do the same to you -- so awareness of your surroundings is paramount.  Balancing this is how free you are to do whatever you\\'d like, exploiting the map for all it\\'s worth.\\nIt will be interesting to see this develop -- hopefully the lag issues and bugs will be patched up and it could be a very interesting multiplayer brawler.',\n",

       "  'text': \"I remember when these games were just flash games and free apps on mobile phones, so it's funny to see where they've ended up. That's not saying that's a bad thing, this game is pretty fun. For me 20 minutes turned into 2-3 hours of games. It's cool to see the formula has been applied with a bunch of different skins that you can unlock by playing more of the game. For those of you unfamiliar with these types of games, you essentially get a certain amount of gold which you use to buy more troops. The more land you have, the more troops you can hire. To defeat your enemy you will certainly need far larger numbers of troops, generally double or so if you're attacking.\\nThis version of the game has added in different unit types, economic upgrades and even buildings that can be built which provide bonuses to all of your troops generally in defense.\\nIn summation, this is a fun game, just as addicting as the ones I used to play on my ipod touch in French 2 back in High school. The additional features aren't many but they are just enough to keep the formula fresh to give it a go a few more times.\\nGameplay Footage:\",\n",

It is very comedic if you don't like goofy stories, but the game is set to be like an 80s cheezie movie. The game sets it-self to have infinite lines to type, so the levels will always be different and just as fun. It has a very good learning curve, so the better you type, the harder it gets, but the slower you type, the more you can better at typing fast as possible. If your not happy with just the typing aspect, then you have one more thing. The game comes with the shooter portion of it, The House of the Dead, Overkill.  Just aim and shoot.

       "  'text': \"There comes another marvelous gem for which it is tremendously hard to write a review and do justice completely without presenting spoilers.\\nis the narrative of a series of staggering experiences concerning a girl named Alice - or many Alices in their different incarnations nonetheless - and her dream of an apocalyptic end. Here, we will participate in her dream many, many times to reach countless endings to try and discover a meaning to it.\\nThe narrative opens with a basic chat screen where Alice talks to her friend M. Hatter and tells him of a disturbingly lucid dream that she has seen the other day. In this unsettling dream, the city is under the threat of getting hit by a series of nuclear missiles due to unknown reasons. The estimation indicates that she'll have a bit more than half an hour to find some kind of protective measure. Here, we become a witness to the before, present and after of a possible nuclear attack and try to lead Alice to some kind of safety while making choices of survival, logic, ethics to reach an ending. We fight against environment, we fight against ourselves; but mostly we fight against time.\\nBefore each playthrough, we are presented the opportunity to choose Alice's stats enrolled into different abilities - consisting of survival, resources, fitness, social abilities, career and dating - to arrange a different incarnation, an alternate dream version of the actual Alice. The combination of different stats change the storyline and starting position for Alice, making different story paths to follow available. In each playthrough different choices and Alice's abilities - and also the exact timing that we chose to take the action during narrative - present countless different combinations, thus different story progressions for Alice. Mostly she dies, sometimes she survives. Yet there is always the reluctant feeling that something's missing is present. As if, that wasn't the way the dream was intended to end... There we go back, start a new game to craft a new Alice and try a new path to follow in hopes of maybe discovering what that was about this time.\\nWe participate in Alice's narrative to make her choices and affect the happenings of her dream past in a frame tale fashion. Alice's narrative of her experience is dreadfully realistic, actualized through an elaborate vocabulary and shockingly pinpoint descriptions. It is confusingly easy to immerse into the narrative experience of Alice, finding yourself trying different combinations of stats and choices endlessly, nearly always discovering some new outcome. The main display consists of nothing much aside some beautiful and appropriately forlorn artwork and the ominous soundtrack lingering in the background to enhance the narrative towards its triumph.\\nAt this point, it should be no secret that the game is inspired from Lewis Carroll's\\nyet it manages to craft the symbolic personifications into a genuine setting of its own; way more realistic and disturbing that Lewis Carroll ever intended them to be so. Aside all of its narrative glory and ever changing gameplay; it is an unbelievable fact that the game is a freeware. Can you even believe it? I'll go ahead and urge you to try this uncanny experience. Maybe this time, Alice will come back from the rabbit hole.\\n*Lyrics by Jefferson Airplane - White Rabbit\\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page\\n- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!\",\n",

       "  'text': 'TLDR: Good concept, bad implementation.\\nHammerfight tests your skill at flying a steampunk helicopter (best description I can think of for someone who hasn\\'t actually seen one), which seems to be refered to as a \"machine\" while attatched to various devices of war which you swing via the momentum imparted by moving your machine. You use this as a weapon in combat aginst whoever is thrown at you.\\nThis review centres around mouse contol as it is the only control in the game.\\nNote: I played the opening chapter of this game while it was free on Steam which was as far as I could before it became thoroughly frustrating. Not due to the game being hard, but because of the many initial obstacles are due to implementation.\\nOnce calibrated, my mouse (Logitech G5 gaming mouse) was able to give me a distinct and measurable feel in moving the machine around, which is great, the initial close quarters fight felt intense and I felt like I had good distinct control over the momentum of my weapon.\\nThat sounds like great implementation. What\\'s wrong with it?\\nAs I progressed through the chapter, I was pitted against more and more foes simultaneously, on progressively larger battlefields. My high precision movements covered a tiny area, and with no other controls than the mouse, I found myself pounding my desk with my mouse as I pick it up to move it back to a comfortable position.\\nWhy not recalibrate your mouse?\\nOkay, So I started again, manually calibrated the mouse to give me greater freedom of movement.\\nPanned in the first fight. Why? That smooth distinct control over the momentum of my machine had gone. But I could move around at pace. A few calibrations later, I still couldn\\'t find an acceptable balance between pace, control and not having to pick the mouse up every time I want to move.\\nWhich brings me to the enemies knockback. When an enemy stikes you, you go flying, not surprising at all, and not a huge problem in game, but you guessed it, you\\'re gonna have to move the mouse if you want to get out of that corner (the sky has corners right? I\\'ll get back to this in a minute.) and this simply added to the wrist flicking madness.\\nMaybe your setup is poor? Do you have a tiny desk?\\nNope. I have two 23inch widescreens, wih room for a third if I really wanted it and the entire width of the 2nd monitor is where my mouse lies.\\nSomething just occured to me, time to Google.\\nI\\'m amazed, this game is NOT a port of a touchscreen tablet title. Which seems absurd, as it occurs to me a touchscreen would be a perfect control method for this type of singe control game.\\nEnough with the controls, what\\'s the rest of the game like?\\nVisually, I like it, the menus are crisp, the setting seems familiar yet unique, (Think Tatooine, but with apparent unlimited access to trees.) The inspiration for the characterisation seems middle-eastern, and the ideas of fame glory being important seem to fit well. The opening does not seem to do justice to the potential of the game, with the first three fights contested in or near grey mountainous regions, and with the grey brown machines, you can easily lose both yourself and your enemies.\\nMechanically, it CAN be good and fun, but I would say only as fun as conkers. (for those of you who didn\\'t grow up in England, we put large seeds on the end of a length of string and take turns bashing them against each other until one breaks.) However, getting back to an earlier point, having the near infinite expanse of the sky to fight in, hitting \"the edge\" is terrible for a sense of immersion.\\nProbably not worth your time, as of 7th May 2014.',\n",

The worldbuilding is great and you get a good feel for the setting with the great combination of music and locale. Even Logan Cunningham's reprisal of An Iconic Voice helped, although it was maybe beating a dead horse a little bit. However, you can tell that these lovingly handcrafted areas took a toll on the designers: Transistor is really, really short. I beat it in 3 hours, and that was a pretty casual playthrough. Of course, there's NG+ and the limiters (similar to the Gods from Bastion), but it's still a great - albeit short - game. Is it worth $20? If you /really/ liked Bastion, sure. $15? Maybe, still a bit pricey for the length though. Definitely worth $10, though!\",\n",

The voice acting is another critical part that makes the game so engaging, with the writing and dialouge choices it's by far the most entertaining part. Despite the other shortcomings, it is quite engaging, and worth a playthrough for story-oriented people.\\nThis is an evolution of the Gone Home style game headed in the right direction, but still suffers from a lack of interesting mechanics and an overemphasis on long slow walks where nothing happens and there isn't even dialogue to keep you awake. And it's not that long walks don't have a purpose in these games, they are a story telling component, it's that most of the time it's filler to pad out length of a pretty short game. Honestly I'd rather the game be shorter than waste my time needlessly, or maybe not a game at all.\\nThey also make a liberal use of jump cuts, which is underutilized in games, but it does it in ways that don't really work. For instance, sometimes they break the tension of a storyline because it just jumps a month into the future, and the thing your character was freaking out about is just a distant memory, or the relationship between the main characters shifts without you really being there or a part of it. I appreciate them trying to move the story along quickly, but the jump cuts should have been more closely scrutinized.\\nTook about 4 hours to complete.\",\n",

It's just repetitive to me; the spells feel weak and shoddy, compared to the monstrous, epic and memorable weapons you see in classics like UT '99 and Quake, and the RPG elements are barely there; they seem to make no difference. There's no doubt that some people will enjoy this game, but many people like myself will just feel disappointed.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Braid is a solid indie title with unique time based mechanics in a puzzle platformer along with great visual and sound design. Immediately upon starting the game, players are shown a rich looking world that resembles a painting. Throughout the game, this painted style along with intricately designed backgrounds looks gorgeous when playing the game along with providing some interesting designs for players to admire. The design manages to be distinct for each game element while looking beautiful for the parts that make up the land of the world. The music matches the refined style of the art with some instrumental pieces that accompany each level. The songs aren't loud in nature, but give a backdrop in each level for players to listen to while solving some of the puzzles. Each song sounds natural with the recorded instruments and still sound nice when applied with some audio effects caused by game events like rewinding time.\\nThe story seems at first to be about a man trying to rescue a princess, but the game goes beyond just that simple story. Throughout the game are books in each world that are read and provide deep meanings with symbolism. Thus, this story is taken more figuratively than literally, and can tend to be confusing much like the actual gameplay.\\nThe gameplay works as a puzzle platformer with unique time based mechanics. By default, the player can rewind time in each world, but each world has its own special mechanics that also deal with time. The player has to solve puzzles using this time mechanic, often with some precision platforming. Each of the puzzles can be difficult to solve, but the levels are designed such that the player can walk past a puzzle to solve it later. Some of the level designs are repeated in this game, but with new twists to be used with a new time based mechanic. The time based mechanics of Braid are amazing for solving the tricky puzzles while also being cool yet confusing when thinking about how some of the mechanics work. Although some of the puzzles can be a pain to figure out or time well with precise actions, Braid tends to be a short game at 5 hours, and maybe more if players are really stuck on some puzzles.\\nBraid has its strong and unique puzzle gameplay while having good design and a story to think about. While the puzzles may be hard at times and the story a bit strange, this is a great indie title to check out and play for the different things it brings in the game.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"A round of Half Dead only takes a few minutes to win or lose.  The game has a very simple concept, but it is also pretty fun if you play with a group of friends. You're stuck somewhere in a grid of adjacent rooms.  One room somewhere in the grid at a location unknown to you contains an exit.  The rest of the rooms contain a surprise that is usually unpleasant. A small number of rooms are safe, most have traps that may kill you if you're not careful, and a few will kill you no matter what you do if you enter. One very interesting mechanic is that you can throw one of your shoes into a room to see if it triggers any traps, but when you're out of shoes, you never know which room may be your last. This leads to very interesting discussions in group chat about finding new pairs of shoes.\\nThe different game modes do very little to add replayability.  We were playing on the hardest difficulty setting and still managed to successfully reach the exit in nearly every game.  The game is fun for a few hours, but I don't see myself coming back to it unless everyone else in my group wants to try it again.\\nDon't buy this game if you intend to play solo.  It's really only enjoyable if you have a group of friends willing to risk life and limb together in a deadly race to the finish.\",\n",

Also there's a plethora of combo cards in this game and unfortunately 95% of them are novelty gag's or downright worthless. The easiest and earliest combo weapons you can make are among the best in the game, which leaves you little to nothing to look forward to.\\nThe game is much more fair than DR1 which is a great and bad thing all at once. The problem with making things fair in a survival horror game is that it takes away a lot of the fear you'd normally have playing it... Although in this game's defense, you can't really begin to play it seriously until you hit level 50... Trying to accomplish anything profound before level 40 and you're basically zombie fodder.

The game takes a lot of time teaching you new mechanics, only to throw them all out the window and start over in the next level with no explanation for how they work in that context.  The rules are always changing and that's not challenging, it's just poor design.  Combat is stiff and restrictive and you will quickly tire of enemies spamming unblockable and nearly undodgable attacks at you.  The camera also glitches out pretty regularly, obscuring your view of enemies in the arena.  The game was already unbearable halfway through and I recommend nobody else put yourself through the frustration of it.\",\n",

I thought the visuals and mood were a lot of fun, and there were some surprisingly solid tunes on the soundtrack.  However, the controls were imprecise, and the online mode seemed a bit unoptimized and laggy.  In some of the later levels, precision was often needed (having to run past an enemy and turn on a dime to shoot him in the back, negotiating turrets which often killed your character outright if you were caught in the line of fire, etc), which compounded these issues.

First off if you even want too get too the point where your character is useless in any player versus player scenarios you are going too have too play a lot and mindlessly grind for hours on end. The second thing about this game is that if you are looking for a MMO too grind on with friends this one is not your MMO this is a single player game and even if you meet up with your friends it feels really bad when fighting raid bosses or any type of enemy. Another thing I really disliked about this game was the auction system in the game, if you go out and play the game and main quest for awhile you should get some money and you probably should go too the auction house too get yourself some good gear, so what you have too do is keep trying to buy items over and over and it can some times take up too an hour too get the item that you want. Thats all I really have too say about this game I didnt enjoy any of the time I spent on this game I came into it with high hopes and was deeply dissapointed.',\n",

It feel more layered, more intricate, the writing feels deeper like there is more going on. It expands on the events and characters from the original very well while also adding more great characters to the universe that are just as good. This time around the game has a very depressing feeling to it mainly because of the concept is you being ‘the last jedi alive’ and roaming around a galaxy that is struggling to recover from the wars that took place. The thing that holds this game back is it’s unfinished state which is why I can’t say it’s better than the original. You can tell when playing because there are areas of the game that feel empty like cantinas with nobody to talk to inside for example and doors that were supposed lead to other areas but unfortunately the developers just didn’t have enough time to finish those areas so the doors remain locked which is a shame. The game has less detail in the world and the environments than the original, it doesn’t feel dense like the original did. It also has a rushed ending so you leave the game with this unfulfilled feeling. I played without the cut content mod because I didn’t know it existed until I was halfway through my playthrough which is a shame because all I hear is great things about it like how it adds more dialogue and events to the game. I do want to play this game again for a third time with the cut content mod in the near future. This game is more of what you loved about the original so it’s a must play if you enjoyed the first.\\n9/10 (Amazing)',\n",

       "  'text': 'It\\'s... honestly not at all what I ended up hoping for. I was hyped at first, considering Lion Game Lion got their start making some pretty nice heists and bonus features for Payday 2, and with the overall rarity of shooters not set in modern or futuristic times, it seemed like it\\'d be unique if nothing else\\nBut... seriously. When you can manage to make a game like this, and make it unsatisfying to even want to load the game up, you\\'ve done something very wrong\\nMechanically, it feels identical to Payday 2 without an Armor system. Which.. admittedly I sort of like, because there\\'s no more having to go to one extreme of being a walking tank or someone who relies on RNG to not die. But about five years of Payday 2 gunplay has gotten extremely stale. Nothing feels satisfying about playing this. Stealing gold is either done Bag Throwing Simulator style (and in a step back bots can\\'t help you carry items like PD2) or you have to go on a bit of a pixel hunt like you would for Gage Packages in PD2. I\\'m A-OK with a little scavenger hunt now and then, but to continue that, your end-of-raid reward is effectively based entirely on how many dog tags you and your friends picked up over the course of the level. Get nothing? You probably got an exp boost for... say, 70. In a game where the average Raid tends to give 1000-1500, even without multipliers\\nAnd that brings me to my biggest complaint. It\\'s. A. GRIND. You get up to 5 character slots (mercifully all unlocked already), and each levels up separately. And you might think that with a level cap of 40 (I think?), it wouldn\\'t be so bad, especially since Payday 2 started out infamously grindy and it had a level cap of 100\\nBut no, you\\'d be wrong. And not only do you have to grind a bit excessively for levels, you have to grind to improve your guns. Yeah, I love the fact that you don\\'t have to pray for mercy from the RNG gods and get the weapon mod you want, when you could potentially get a mask or mask customization item you didn\\'t want, and I love the idea of having your weapons improve with time. But things like \"Kill 500 enemies who are 20+ meters away with this weapon to get a very minor recoil decrease\" is just... excessive, to me\\nAll this grind says to me, we have nothing to keep our players invested, so let\\'s force them to spend more time trying to unlock things. Grinding\\'s not a problem until it gets excessive, when it takes you so long to get one simple thing that you\\'d be better off ignoring it entirely, and I wasn\\'t even halfway through leveling up ONE class before that set in for me. And this is coming from a guy who\\'s got at least four Final Fantasy games under his belt\\nI honestly hate talking this badly about this game, because it\\'s very clear LGL cares for it and they have good intentions. And yeah, it has some great stuff. Decent enough writing, very nice weapon selection (aesthetics from mods aside, dear god it gives cod ww2 a run for its money in how wrong those look. Have you SEEN an M1 Garand with a BOX MAGAZINE?) and animation, and each Raid feels like it has a unique goal from the outset instead of \"Hit this place for money, now hit that one\", especially since you\\'re not entirely out for cash in them. Plus, changing your jacket/pants is a lot cooler than PD2\\'s lackluster mask customization, and (at least in the case of tops) it\\'s something you actually see for more than two seconds. And the comic that came with it is a bit of a fun read, it\\'s not long and it\\'s not a masterpiece but it\\'s nicely-done\\nI guess if I had to sum all this up it would be... this game has potential. But it\\'s going to take it a while to reach it, and most of its problems aren\\'t even its own fault. THAT would be the result of using Payday 2\\'s wonderfully bad engine\\nI mean like all reviews this is pretty subjective, and you\\'re more than welcome to disagree, but.. really, if you walked up to me on a street and asked me \"Should I buy this game\", I would just tell you no, and all of that up there is the reason why\\nThough I do have one last thing to mention, one of the game\\'s biggest saving graces. The videos. The live-action bits with John Cleese, all the Hitler videos if you win a mission where he has the most hilarious breakdowns. Those alone, I think, are worth a mention. They perfectly embody the sort of off-beat approach this game has. They add that last little bit of satisfaction to a well-done raid, and it\\'s clear that everyone involved in the videos was enjoying their roles, especially ol toothbrushe stache himself\\nSo that\\'s about all I\\'ve got to say. I won\\'t outright call it a bad game, especially with the respect I have for LGL, but it\\'s not one I would honestly recommend. At least not yet. If it gets better in the future I might be able to change this, as I have with many other games (see: Payday 2, Team Fortress 2)\\nAlthough uh... Unless you want the really nice-looking Golden M1 Garand, and the extra two melee weapons you get... The Special Edition ain\\'t worth it. Not at all. You get a giant jacket with Special Edition logos on each shoulder, you get a Candy Apple skin for the Kubelwagen (including generic ones on the roadside) and yes it ALSO has Special Edition text.. That one gets a pass because it actually looks cool, but still: seeing the whole \"SPECIAL EDITION\" logo on EVERYTHING about it gets annoying. If you do want this game, do yourself a favor and ignore the Special Edition. It\\'s not worth the $15 extra (unless, as mentioned, you REALLY want that Golden M1 and the Candy Apple Kubelwagen)',\n",

       "  'text': '27-Jul-2016 : Finished main story + extras\\nEquipment : MSI GT80-2QE Notebook\\nREVIEW :\\nFirst thing first, this is not arcade space sim combat like Elite Dangerous, this is RPG game with space sim combat. You start with a small ship and you can play it like arcade space sim combat since the RPG elements seems irrelevant at the beginning. But as your rank get higher and you get access to bigger ships, you find yourself constantly outnumbered and outgunned. Tactical combat and RPG elements (properly developed character and ship) becomes essential to win a combat.\\nThe game is open world. To be powerful enough to progress through the main quest, you can do faction side quests, freelance quests, mining. trading, bounty hunting, pirating and capturing ships. The graphics and soundtrack is great, the story is mediocre with really bad voice acting. This game is not a high budget A-List game, so there\\'s no fancy 3D cutscenes with motion tracking and real voice actors.\\nThe game also really mod-friendly. You can edit stats and even your savegames using a simple text editor. This mod-friendly approach is more handy that it seems. For example, my favorite Carrier-class ship doesn\\'t come with a cloaking device. Easy, edit the ship stats file using Notepad and add the cloaking device myself. There\\'s also Mod Tools to build your own contents. If you\\'re a Trekkie, make sure you try the Star Trek Ship Mods in the Steam Workshop.\\nThe developer also generous enough to give a free DLC titled \"Origins\". This free DLC offers 30 storyline missions of the original Starpoint Gemini, re-envisioned and ported to SPG2 engine. So if you never play the 1st one, you can play it now without extra cost. Basically you get 2 games for the price of one.\\nCONCLUSION :\\nRecommended on full price, a must-have on sale price.',\n",

       "  'text': \"The game's main bait is the cool cartoonish look and animations. However, 30 minutes or less is all you need to experience all the game has to offer. Sure there are some additional bells and whistles that drop every once in a while as you progress, but they're requisites on top of a core that stays unchanged. So what fails?\\nGame design\\nAs good as it looks in a 2-minute gameplay video or on a screenshot, the design doesn't have the depth and variety to make a 10-hour game. It just get's worn out.\\nLevel design\\nHere's probably the weakest aspect of the whole game. You get the same level design with mild variations from beginning to the end. Too soon it starts to feel like doing chores.\\nIn-game tasks\\nYou have to complete small in-game tasks to earn points to level up. The tasks, however rather break the immersion than add anything to it. Most often they were just annoying, at best neutral, not once thrilling.\\nStory\\nThe ending was surprisingly good in many ways. The rest of the story was plain and uninteresting though. Sad thing is, that a good story would have helped a lot to make up for some other missing features.\\nMechanics\\nThere's a strong stealth system built into the game, equal to the Hitman series. Here's where the game shines most. You sneak, hide, distract, terrorize, confuse, stealth kill enemies and more. Having pulled that off in 2D makes the outcome even sweeter. The power-ups shine with originality and come in handy, whatever approach you choose to go with. And on top of that, the quick time events while killing with a sword, gives a nice extra touch.\\nReplayability\\nLots of replay value for three reasons:\\n1. Great game for speedrun.\\n2. You can try to complete all the mini-tasks and find all the hidden places.\\n3. Upon finishing the game you unlock a new difficulty mode with tougher challenges.\\nVerdict\\nI found myself struggling to finish the game because of the repetitive level design and the overall routine that I felt while playing. The in-game tasks made it feel like a competitive game, common to sports genre, whereas it should have focused more on the immersion and atmosphere. Despite the power-ups I didn't feel like there was much character development going on. Besides the philosophical ramblings thrown at you time after time, you never really get to know the character.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'At first, I liked Mother Russia Bleeds. It\\'s a fairly basic, cathartic, lovingly-drawn-in-pixel side-scrolling brawler that somehow takes the award from Hotline Miami for \"Most Grimy, Violent, ♥♥♥♥ed-Up Game I Have Ever Played.\" I started out having enough fun with it, but as time went on the game revealed that its entire difficulty curve is composed of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\\n♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, at least in my book, is gameplay design that allows players to lose health, die, or otherwise fail for reasons beyond their control. The main way Mother Russia Bleeds uses it is with stunlocking: every other enemy can get you in ridiculous long, damaging combos that leave you completely helpless for what seems like minutes, while other enemies hit you or prevent you from completing objectives that only have a window of a second or two where they\\'re doable. You\\'ll race toward an ally you need to quickly heal and keep alive, or a special enemy you have to kill as fast as possible, and some yahoo will jump out of nowhere and pin you down for a veritable eternity as that ally dies or enemy barrels towards you. Every single goddamn level is like this, and the bosses are somehow even worse. They\\'ve all got some dumb gimmick that takes forever to do, and none of them have health bars so you have no idea how far you are. The final boss, which has, like, four stages, took me SEVENTY MINUTES to kill, mostly because I kept failing when some pointless rando jumped on me just as I was about to do something important, and then his three friends joined in on the fun. What\\'s more, because I used a health item at any point during that fight, I got the bad ending. ♥♥♥♥in\\' ♥♥♥♥ you, game.\\nAdding to this frustration is the checkpoint system. Not how it revives you; that\\'s pretty good and forgiving, and is the only thing that got me through the game at all. It\\'s a noticeably more infrequent towards the end, but that\\'s a comparatively minor issue. No, the problem I have is with how often it saves; that is to say, only at the start of chapters, which are ♥♥♥♥ing far apart. The reason I didn\\'t quit that seventy-minute marathon of a final boss halfway through and, I dunno, break an end table, was that if I did I\\'d have to redo the entire chapter before that. Another time, the game basically crashed right before a chapter boss, making me restart and losing me a half hour of progress. ♥♥♥♥. THAT. This is one reason why I advocate manual saves: as a backup against technical issues.\\nI\\'m certain Mother Russia Bleeds is better in co-op, where you can save your friends from all the stunlocks and hurt bosses way faster. However, in single player, it\\'s just a ♥♥♥♥ing chore, one that I unfortunately cannot recommend. I want to like Mother Russia Bleeds, with its lovingly animated pixel violence and crunchy sound design and commitment to being completely tasteless and edgy, but it keeps getting in the way of its best qualities with its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It\\'s a shame more than anything. Waste of a good opportunity.\\nAlso, the dialogue is perfunctory ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and there\\'s a ton of it. You can skip it, but still.',\n",

       "  'text': \"You play like an alpha tester for a game in progress, although obviously more fun than the real life equivalent. Instead of looking for bugs, documenting and making repeatable cases, etc. you just do whatever you want and explore an unfinished open world. You don't really look for bugs but you're often rewarded with story logs if you explore places you're not 'supposed' to get to.\\nThe developers are basically gods that can change the game world at an instant and at their whim. And while Ish especially has many whims, there were times during game development that others (for better or worse) helped stagnate development.\\nStory was fun, discovering what happened in the past via audio logs was nice, music was nice, visuals were (intentionally at times) mediocre. I felt most of the overworld graphics were suitable to the game; black and white made it feel like sketch work. But sometimes in other areas the graphics were intentionally so old it figuratively hurt me to play through all the jagged lines and low res graphics. But even the overworld graphics/assets, if colored and used in a proper game, would look very mediocre by today's standards.\\nThe big draw in gameplay for me is that you get to change attributes on creatures/objects you find in the game. Each creature has its own properties (like movement: ground, attack: melee, special ability: fireproof, ally: hero, enemy: none). You can take these properties and then place it on other objects. So you can take a rock and make it mobile, your ally (so it follows you as a pet), and attack with flames.\\nYou do so much walking in this game that it really would be nice for a run/sprint button even if momentum didn't carry over to jumps. I would have liked to move faster, jump length wasn't really a problem.\\nOther thoughts:\\nWorth a try if you like the idea of a pseudo-programming/game dev game. I'm not aware of another game that plays this angle with this gameplay.\\nTo be honest, I wanted more from the game. I was hoping that eventually you could edit your own properties. I only found 7 actions/attacks to choose from and 5 special properties. It's a decent amount because they're very distinct (no ice beam vs fire beam) but not quite satisfying if you want a sandbox. But even then, you don't really find a place that you need to use all of them. It's really just enough to get through the story.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I honestly enjoy playing the game, but in order for the major fixes to be fixed, it needs to be given a down grade.\\nPros/Things Civ fixed from last game:\\nHappiness: Now luxuries can go to multiple cities and each city has its own happiness\\nDistricts/Wonders: Gave a brand-new aspect to the game, gives each city its own specialty from a science/culture city to a military/gold city and everything inbetween. Wonders now are placed on titles of their own which leads to a more space management system which is interesting.\\n(I will say that if the districts are pillaged, then it takes forever to rebuild them, needs a fix)\\nArmy/Navies: Now you can combine military units into corps (2 in 1) and armies (3 in 1) starting in later years. Something I personally have been waiting for a long time since Revolution. Great adition and helps with waging wars\\nWorkers: debuffed workers so they have a specific number of builds while also making them cost less. Great idea and still very easy to industrialize nation.\\nGovernments/Policies: Made 9 types of governments that have specific sections of military/economic/diplomacy/wildcare sections to personalize the governments. So now you can have a merchant republic with a conscription card. Great addition but needs to be given greater variety in terms of number of governments\\nCons/Need to change:\\nDiplomacy: Again, Civ seems to have made diplomacy even worse now. Wars that you start immediately makes everyone hate you, even if you are asked to declare war by someone else. Being attacked and then taking a city in retalition makes everyone hate you. Doing something that is against the other civ's personality (ie: Not have a strong army with Egypt in the game, Egypt hates you). This makes the game more interesting but still annoying\\nBarbarians: Completely buffed barabarians to make them as strong as your units without a special card, and even with it, still a pain to fight off. Most of the time i play without them because its just so annoying. Spawn rate for them is also buffed, you basically have to get as strong of an army as to take on another civ, just to take out a village or 2.\\nTrading: Civ made the Ai hate you even more during trades, makes it so you have to give up twice what you are getting in return so only if you are really desperate will you trade with them. The only way you get a fair 1:1 trade is when you have declared friendship, and with the picky nature of Ai, its much more difficult to declare friendship with them. Its almost like you have to specifically play a certain way to get 1 Ai to be your friend.\\nMaps/your placement on them: I dont know quite what Civ did but somehow, getting placed on maps got worse. About 1 in every 5 map placements are decent, and the other 4 are either being placed directly in tundra, within 2 titles of tundra, in deserts, or in jungles which aren't so bad. Doesn't matter what type of map you use. I also noticed you dont get many resources near you unless you click the abundant resources in the map settings. This part isn't really bad, just weird to me.\\nNo mod tool yet: Absolutely no way for modders to come in and help the game's bugs and just plain not readiness. Currently they say its under production and will be out soon so don't quote me on this one.\\nOverall: Great game base, foundation really solid and new and ready for the fixes to come. Honestly game still seems to be in a late beta mood and just needs the diplomacy fix and a few tweaks here or there.\\nRecommendation: Buy the game and enjoy the aspects that are good, and wait for them to be fixed. Or if you want a finished game, wait for the mod tool to come out, thats when the game can be fixed properly.\",\n",

While these levels are more challenging than original version it would have been better to maybe have added more original levels instead.\\nOverall this is a pretty decent game and worth picking up if you enjoy puzzle games.

       "  'text': 'Life is Strange isn\\'t just the best adventure game ever made (Sorry Laura Bow!), it\\'s one of the best games ever made.  I\\'d easily call it Game of the Year 2015 (Sorry Witcher 3 your ending is bssssssssss).  Just as Witcher 3 showed how abysmal Draong Age 3 is, Life is Strange showed what a pos all the Tell Tale games are.  This is literally everything the Tell Tale games should have been.  A fantastic interactive story with explorable environments, actual puzzles, amazing writing, and decisions that actually matter.  It\\'s not just a choose your own adventure video like those simple Tell Tale games where you barely even get to walk around, the world in Life is Strange feels like a living world instead of just short meaningless scenes strung together.\\nSo for starters I love the art direction.  It\\'s a very stylized game, it\\'s not cartoony, but their is no mistaken that they were not trying to make things as life like as possible.  The stylized nature fits in with the narrative of our character being an artist and surrounded by other artists at the school.  The setting of Arcadia Bay, Oregon really does come across as this small sleepy town in the middle of nowhere.  Particularly, the school of Blackwell Academy comes across exactly how highschool life is (although, even most private schools in the US don\\'t have dorms).  It felt so much like highschool I was literally constantly stressed during every Blackwell part of the game, because I despiseddddddd highschool.  It got to the point in the game where I was nervous talking to anyone because I just thought they would bully me (once i realized i could just rewind literally every interaction it became easier).  I\\'ve never had such an emotional reaction to any game I\\'ve ever played.\\nThe Twin Peaks, X-files, and Silent Hill vibe is strong with this one.  Playing this game feels like being in these worlds. Their is a constant sense that something is just not quite right, that a darker secrets underlie everything.  If this town was incased in fog (SH2) or snow (SH5) this would be Silent Hill.  Hell there is even a lighthouse that features prominently in the game.  One particularly sequence in the game takes place at night with flashlights and it felt so much like an X-files ep or my time walking around the Hospital in Silent Hill 2 that I was terrified.  The entire time I expected some horrifying thing to just jump out and murder me.  As in Twin Peaks, X-files, and Silent Hill the game does have supernatural undertones.  I mean...you can time travel, but more then that you constantly have the feeling that other supernatural forces are at work in this town.  Which is conveyed more through the way sunlight and shadow plays off things rather then the narrative itself.  It gives a feeling of unease that otherwise shouldn\\'t be there.\\nSound does play a part in this of course.  The music selections are all impeccable.  Where Akira Yamaoka\\'s score in the Silent Hill series is literally legendary for creating that games world.  The indie music composed by Jonathan Morali for this game breathes life into this world.  I can\\'t even imagine any other music in this game.  Every scene feels built around a specific song, from literally the start menu right down to what plays on your characters ipod.  I would probably even say Morali managed to surpass Yamaoka\\'s score, but it\\'s hard to say.  Where Yamaoka\\'s scores created a atmosphere of a tense unsettling mystery, Morali went with a more serene folk rock style for most scenes.  When juxtaposed with the serious issues surrounding the game (suicide, bullying, drug addiction, depression, and of course sexual abuse) it creates for some very peaceful moments while at the same time being very unsettling.  I think the whole idea behind the storm framing narrative is that you are at the eye of the storm where it is serene and beautiful while everything around you is chaos.  The music reflects and builds on this theme perfectly just as the Silent Hill 2 soundtrack did for that game.\\nI also just have to bring up the voice acting in this game.  I have played a lot of adventure games with some atrocious voice acting...in fact most adventure games (I\\'m looking at you Black Mirror and Syberia!).  I don\\'t think I can say one bad thing about the voice acting for any character in this game.  Now that doesn\\'t mean the dialogue they were given is all stellar, but the actual delivery is superb.  Chloe is probably my favorite, but Max\\'s voice conveys more then anything how nervous and uncomfortable her character is around everyone.  You can\\'t play this game and not understand that Max is someone who is worried about every single action she makes and every word she says.  This is all conveyed through her voice acting.  The voice acting quality is so good that quite frankly it will be hard to play an adventure game that has anything less.\\nSo this is an adventure game, so puzzles are the main \"gameplay\" element.  These are my favorite type of adventure game puzzles.  They aren\\'t the utter bs of combing random items together that should never be combined to make a simple object like a hammer when their are probably tool boxes full of hammers everywhere in the game (see every Lucasarts adventure game).  Nor are they the nonsensical math puzzles of The Dig, Black Mirror, Myst, the 7th Guest and many others (math isn\\'t fun!).  These are the logical type of puzzles and pretty much all revolve around you using your time travel ability.\\nSo finally we come to narrative, which literally is the main factor in whether an adventure game succedes or not.\\nThis story is so well done I don\\'t care, this is the spiritual successor to Silent Hill 2 that I always dreamed of.  This game is a masterpiece that everyone should play.  #Worth ANY PRICE',\n",

       "  'text': \"Zombie Army Trilogy is a third person shooter that support both single and co-op gameplay.\\nThe story takes place in alternative timeline of World War II era where German's final plan is to unleash an ancient power, but something goes wrong and overruned by undead army.\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\nThe gameplay is straightforward; the goal is to proceed from point A to B along with some objectives. Each level serves variety of world setting and captures the sense of hopeless. They are massive, detailed, and have some memorable moment even though the gore stuffs are bit exceed and unnecessary to create the atmosphere in cheap way. Horde mode is optional survival mode, but encourages your strategy and teamwork as well.\\nThe gunplay is by far the strongest point and satisfied. Each sniper rifle has different fire rate, magazine size, velocity (which affect on higher difficulty), and zoom level. The game borrows most mechanics from Sniper Elite and execute very well, because sniping zombie requires more steady aim and prediction. It also offers a great challenge on higher difficulty as you have to make every headshot and less secondary ammo to emphasize the usage of sniper rifle. Keep it mind that your bullet works as projectiles and can accidently hit the wall if you aim near the corner.\\nYou will encounter most of common zombie and skeleton. There are some elites and specials which force you to prioritize and change position, although most of spawn point are pretty much static as you can predict where they come including items and explosives.\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\nHowever, random elements are low and cause no replayability unless you need to collect all achievements on higher difficulty which replaces more Elite spawn points. Collectable are fun to hunt, but it doesn't reward anything besides achievements. There are some rare bugs / glitches where the enemies could be stuck in level and prevent player to proceed or the game won't allow you to collect more explosives.\\nOverall, Zombie Army Trilogy is very entertaining, challenge, and well-optimized. Single player could be very terrified and intense while co-op is fairly messy and hilarious with your friends.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Awesomenauts is a 2D MOBA (Multiplayer online battle arena), with a strong sense of progression, and a lot of different dynamics that can be taken into account. I don\\'t really have anything negative to say about the game, read on if you want to know more specifics!\\n\\nTwo sides are at war, choose your awesomenaut and ship out and defeat the other team! As you would expect from a game based completely on battling there isn\\'t much to explain about the story, there is a nice opening cinematic that has a hilarious similar to a Power Rangers episode, but other than that the game is mostly an exchange of  going back and forward fighting indefinitely.\\nThe controls are best explained while playing the game. the movement is ASDW, you can use W or space to jump, some characters have a double jump, some fly. You use both mouse buttons and the scroll lock click to use various abilities. The button configuration is very toned down, you\\'re limited on what abilities you can use, and before you start the game you select the abilities you want to unlock as you play the game.\\nOkay, now I should say something about the various characters, there are A LOT of characters which might compliment your play style. I tried them all while playing \"offline practice mode\", I found my favorite character and then intended to play as that character until I became very familiar with the game.\\nAs you play through the game (even playing offline practice mode) you will received experience that will unlock new awesomenauts and abilities for your awesomenauts. This element in the game gives me a very strong sense of progression throughout the game. (coupled with getting a lot of easy-to-earn-achievements that I earned while playing offline! (Thank you for that Awesomenauts!)\\nI keep talking about \"offline practice mode\", the reason I do is because I spent a lot of time playing in this mode before starting the game. When I first played this game I tried to play it with my friend, we were both equally noobish at what was going on, I didn\\'t even know this was a MOBA! So naturally we got ourselves massacred. :( Left a bad taste in my mouth...\\n...But! after I discovered offline practice mode, I learned on my own without looking up guides how I wanted to play the game. Naturally if I wanted to get better guides would help, but I like to think I\\'m a fairly competent gamer, playing offline let me try out various characters and strategies without dragging down my team. You can adjust the AI to make practice easier or more difficult depending on your confidence.\\nA final note about playing through the game, you start the game out with \"solar\" or \"coins\", you collect more of these from killing various npc / players, as you collect more, you return to your base to purchase upgrades for your awesomenaut making him/her stronger. knowing which ones to upgrade and which ones to select take practice, guides, or strategy. Once again, if you want to actually learn the game, try out offline practice mode to see what I mean! :D\\n\\nI got a bit ahead of myself earlier with a note about the achievements. They were mostly straightforward:  Win games, play games, taunt your enemy, go on a crazy killing spree, hoard up Solar (in-game currency) and then the rest are pretty much grind grind grind. Grind creep kills, grind turret kills, grind online game wins.\\nMost of the simple achievements are simple, most of the grinding achievements you should just play the game to enjoy the game, let those grindy achievements happen if they happen. That is Atratzu\\'s suggestion for this game\\'s achievements.\\nAwesomenauts costs $9.99, So far (08/16/14) I\\'ve played 5.7 hours. I\\'ve really enjoyed learning how the game works, but my \"value system\" dictates that I need to spend at least 9 hours in the game to make it worth-my-while. I definitely think this game has that type of replay-ability.\\nAs always, I recommend buying games when they\\'re on sale, or getting them in humble bundles, I was given this game as a gift from one of my friends (You know who you are). And we haven\\'t gotten around to playing together, but this game would really be fun to play with friends.\\n\\nComing into this review, I knew from the start that I didn\\'t really have anything negative to say about the game. *IF* there was one thing I would like to have in the game that I didn\\'t have, I would like to play offline practice with my friends over steam, but that doesn\\'t take away from the game in any way.\\nOnce again, story was \"meh\" but amusing, game play was \"engaging different and fun\", achievements were \"okay\", and the price was \"fair\". I recommend this game to anyone who likes 2D platformers, and competitive battle games. If you would like to play it sometime with me, you\\'re welcome to do so; I intend to continue playing this game over time. I really enjoyed it.',\n",

The maps are nicely made allowing easy ways to flank and take on base defenses without feeling like your being beaten down by a bat.\\nThe only issue I do have is the bots as they are extremely useless in many cases...most times they just sit around base or charge a single area.

The physics engine is okay, pulling stuff up a hill feels rough at times and I think some tractors or combines slow down too much when pulling stuff up a hill (A 1100 PS Krone combine can't pull 50.000L silage up a ≈10° inclination for example), but after all the feeling when driving a vehicle is pretty okay, it feels similar to Euro Truck Simulator 2 in some aspects.\\nThe multiplayer is a blast aswell. Everything is more fun with friends, from managing your farm over harvesting your crop to fooling around with a Telehandler.

The guys will stop to search you after a while, and they do always same patrol moves.\\nSo, overhole, it\\'s a good game, but you will play again after end just one time or two : there\\'s no multi-players mode, it\\'s not an open world too, you can\\'t travel into a city as you want.\\nSo if you can have this game in sold today, around 10 bucks, it\\'s ok, it worth it.

       "  'text': \"Remember Me is one of the best games ever made. It's top notch story, artwork and graphics that will leave you stunned, and great musical score makes this game something you 'll never want to forget. The only downside is the first few levels leave the combat a little meh(~2 Hours).\\nThe Story:\\nWithout spoiling anything Remember Me is a game where you think you know what's going to happen. When you finally play it you'll see that there is even more then you thought. The story in this game is one of the best stories ever told in a Big Budget released titles. The world feels real and the story plays off this amazingly constructed world perfectly. It may even make you rethink how you view your own memories.\\nThe Graphic/Artwork:\\nThe detail in this game is above any other I've seen. Little robot float by with signs showing you the specials of places to eat or shops. The floating text  of the signs are at the perfect depth in order to feel as if they are realistically placed. Dirty places feel dirty and not over done just like clean places feel just the right amount of clean. Nothing is over done and the detail is so perfect it's insane to think about. You really feel as if you are part of the world. The 3D is also very good.\\nThe Sound/Music:\\nThe Musical score in this game is perfect as well. It combines classic big orchestra sound with corrupt technology sounds in the perfect manner. Sound is one of my favorite things in a game so even if this styles sounds crazy even at first I didn't believe how well it sounded.\\nThe voice acting in the game is great only maybe 3 lines in the game feel out of place. Each actor adds emotion to their character and draws you into the story and scene. The combat sounds can get a little repetitive though because the enemy are always saying the same one liner all the time. Nothing that can't be over look.\\nThe combat noises and ambient sounds are also really well done. You heard ADs over a PA system about a product in the world or what just happened in the news. Robots talk about protocol for the area or you just hear people talking in the streets.  You can hear the distant sounds of computers running around a corner or a leaper hiding the shadows. The combat noise of punches landing and other abilities hitting are fine as well. Things sound satisfying when they land and never out of place.\\nThe Gameplay:\\nThe gameplay is one of the weakest parts of Remember Me at the start of the game. You don't have many abilities, pressens, or combos and it can feel as if you are just spamming the one or two combos you do have in order to just get through. When you finally unlock everything the style of combat you do is almost an art of itself. It flows so well and looks very good. At the beginning of the game it can seem that the combat is down right bad but give it time it gets really fun.\\nThe platforming in Remember Me in very linear as the game is pretty much 95% linear. There are a few places you can go in order to find collectibles but other then that it's pretty much follow this path. The platforming is pretty easy and really just something you do in order to find the solutions to puzzle as it's pretty hard to fail these sections. Overall the platforming is neither good nor bad it's pretty ok.\\nAll in all if you are looking to pick up Remember Me I strongly suggest you do. I played it the whole way through in Nvidia 3D and it was great. I recommend using a controller so you can lean back and enjoy this amazing game.\\nBy far the Must Play Game of 2013.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"The next (il)logical progression in the Saint's Row series... We are now a super-powered POTUS... *facepalms*\\nIn all honesty, the game is pretty good, and the story, dialog and characters are just as sill (if not more so) than before, so you're bound to be laughing out loud more than a few times as you play. The downside is that the game is almost a carbon-copy of SR3. Yes, there are some changes; no cribs just gateways to the ship, cosmetic changes to the city, etc... but you're still in Steelport, or a least a version of it, so there's nothing new to explore. There are also less activites, and instead of how they were in SR3, where each had it's own goal and that was that, now they all have 3 levels of completion; Bronze, Silver and Gold, so instead of a new mission each time you're replaying the same levels over again to get higher scores, which gets grind-like after a while of trying to score Gold on all instances of an activity to complete a Challenge and get the reward.\\nAs for DLCs, aside from Enter The Dominatrix and How the Saints Save Christmas, their all cosmetic stuff that gets old fast, so unless you *really* want them, you can ignore them.\\nReplay value here is low, since there are no alternate solutions to some mission like there were in SR3 (the ones linked to the achievements). And aside from two achievements linked to play time and playing as both a Male and Female character for a certian amount of time, you'll probably just beat the game in co-op and single player once or twice and that'll be that.\\nNow, I know everything I've said has been harsh, but thats just the truth. The game itself is great, and unless Volition changes their minds, this is the last Saints Row game we're ever gonna see, so if you liked the series, at least pick this up when it's on sale and give it a go.\\nEDIT: This may not be the last Saints Row game, but I'm not sure. As far as I remember, I read several articles on this being the last SR game we'll see. However, given how there's still a decent community for this game, from modders to players, and the devs are willing, we may see a SRV... but I wouldn't hold my breath.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"For once it's Hercules managed to get in trouble and captured twice, you need another hero... his dear and tender Megara! Roles are reversed! So instead of having a Hercules that does nothing, here's come Megara... that isn't more active than him. But she's more useful than him: she can grow plants that will give you food.\\nIndeed, as for the previous games, you sent your servants for resources gathering (gold, food, wood) in order to build or to expand houses, workshops, farms or gold mines that are periodically giving you... resources. But beware of the thieves that will take them if you're not fast enough! As usual, you have bonuses for stopping time, making the servants (or resources) work/walk faster, making more resources, etc... Nothing really changed from the previous games. Even Cerberus, Medusa or Pegasus are still present. There is however a new character, Charon, that can bring resources that are floating for one piece of gold.\\nSo without real innovation, how come this game isn't boring? Because there is a challenge of beating high scores, because you want to see how the story finishes. That's the main reasons, for me at least. Indeed, the casual difficulty removes the timer and the Olympic time, so you have all the time in the world to finish the level. The normal difficulty has the timer while the higher difficulty has less time (and more points). Besides, you can unlock bonus levels by finding pieces of puzzles and reconstitue them.\\nGraphics are like the previous game, very colorful and nice for a casual game. The soundtrack is still the same.\\nIf you liked the two previous games, you'll like this one. You'll like also the fact that Hercules is the one to be saved now and that thanks to Megara, you'll have food quite early in the game that will appear periodically. The challenge is still present, so, yeah, you can go ahead, the price isn't too high, you have trading cards, achievements...\",\n",

I'm not sure why it has gotten so many favorable reviews, because it doesn't deserve them.\\nGame controls (at least for PC) are absolutely horrible.  Three attacks are allowed and two of those are special and on long timers.   Thirty percent of the time,  the game animation over-rides the ability to use the special attacks.\\nBait and switch during boss battles (i..e., running around and letting a boss beat on you while some special power sucks the life outta you) is absolutely painful, even on casual.  Its almost as if the game is negatively encouraging you to replay completed levels over and over in order to get the weapons and cards necessary to defeat a boss.\\nAdd in the fact that the weapons are basically uninteresting variations on three items - hammer, sword, shotgun, and it's basically a frustration-fest.  The demonic powers your supposed to obtain with the Overcharge ability are absolutely laughable...you push and push to get the overcharge event going and are rewarded with an unimpressive spurt of power.  To make matters more frustrating, Overcharge trickles away about 5 times faster than it takes to build up, ensuring that you surely wont use it often.\\nI'll give the designers credit for the ambience and graphics, theyre pretty good, but gameplay totally ruins any kudos they might have gotten for that.\\nMerchants are also horrible - I have yet to see any affordable weapons for sale that are useful at all (at least through level 10 when I finally said enough, and stopped playing).  Potions, what there are of them through level 10, are on timers, and are a complete waste of the gamer's coinage.  You can easily find potions just as good as you play though a level.\\nThe game looks good, i'll give them that...but the gameplay is absolutely boring and uninspired and didn't draw me in to continue playing it.  Even having Geralt of Rivia's voice as the protagonist didn't persuade me to play a moment longer.\\nBasically 4/10 - would not purchase again.\",\n",

Many players may find the game confusing at first, and for others the combat will not be lively or vigorous enough, but as with any MMO these aspects can be improved over time. What will certainly not change is the inherent difficulty infused into the game by holding players responsible for their actions. This game isn't for everyone, and that may be the most compelling reason to try it for yourself.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"The only real objective is to set things on fire. The whole game is set in a single fixed camera view of a fireplace. You use coins to purchase a variety of objects to set on fire, and if you set specific items on fire at the same time, it counts as a combo which gives you a bonus. That process alone, buying each item and doing each combo, took about 5 hours for me to do. For such a simple premise, there's a lot of content to work with.\\nIt's not just a singular concept, though. There's an underlying plot. That too is a bit simple, but it's still very interesting. I find it might be more enjoyable to personally experience learning the plot, rather than read about it from someone else. And for me, there were two parts of plot development that I found somewhat disturbing/freaky/unsettling - which I find a positive attribute, because rarely can a game affect me on that level.\\nEither way, it's just a fun way to spend time. I think it has replayability, because even after seeing all the objects set on fire, it's still cool to mess around with putting together multiple objects to see the outcome, but also simply because you get to set things on fire, so it's fun to just start it up for a quick session just for that sake.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Hand of Fate 2 is a mixed bag, especially if you have played the first game.  For starters, yes, this game is MASSIVELY improved from the original, with different weapons, companions, and chance encounters like dice, wheels, and pendulum challenges which make it more about skill and helps to mitigate RNG.  However, it also has problems with creativity.  If we compare it to the original, the basic four types of enemies were bandits, rat men, skeletons, and lizard folk.  Variations of those and special monsters made that game feel like a true fantasy romp, but here...we get humans...but barbarians.  Humans...but in armor.  Humans...but thieves. And humans...but corpses.  We lack a lot of the interesting or imaginative monsters of yesteryear.\\nThe quests in the game are much more varied and interesting, but they can wear on you, as some of the quests are unforgivably tedious and frustrating, especially if you want to get the true rewards. The story is more focused and if you are interested in worldbuilding and incremental storytelling, it's pretty interesting, as you learn about your history up to when you start the game...then go beyond it.  It's cool, but you lose some of the fun of making your own story about your life from the first game. Also, you have an insane amount of encounters, which is great for endless mode, but can be tedious for deck building, as you will wade through hundreds of cards to build a deck to help you with each challenge. Filters help, but only so much.\\nNotice how I'm not talking about the combat?  Because it's pretty meh.  It's Arkham counter, break block, attack rinse repeat over and over again.  It has a level of skill to it, but the storytelling is the draw here and the game is at its weakest when it forces you into encounter after encounter after encounter.\\nDespite my complaints, I had a good time with Hand of Fate 2.  It begins to fizzle out near the end, however I do appreciate the ending for what it is in relation to the story and also for not being a grindy slog, but a final boss battle that you can repeat easily if you wish and which is pretty bloody satisfying.  Gets rid of a real pet peeve of mine.  Do I recommend it?  Eh...yes.  Play the first Hand of Fate before this as you'll get more out of the story and mechanical improvements, but it is an interesting experience and fun...most of the time.\",\n",

Then I stumbled across The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky.  After checking it out a bit, I decided to get it and see what it was like.  What I found amazed me.  I found a game that had just about everything that I could have asked for in a game of this genre.  I felt invested in the story from the start, something that many games try to accomplish, but fail.  I discovered a cast of eight like able and relatable main characters, along with a good many well-done supporting characters, expansive towns that were filled with NPCs that had unique and diverse dialogues, and a game that takes well over 50 hours to beat.  The soundtrack is amazing:  I did not hear a single track during the game that I did not like or that I did not think was appropriate for the circumstances.  The humor is well done, and dispersed widely enough that I did not feel that it was coming too quickly, but I was still left with a smile on my face for most of the game.  The graphics are a little dated, but since I prefer a compelling story over good graphics, I was able to overlook that, and despite the fact that they are dated, they still look really good.  The combat runs smoothly, without dragging on like it is liable to do in some games.  All in all, I would highly recommend this game to any fan of the JRPGS genre, and I know that I will definitely return to this game for many years.',\n",

I’ve not done everything possible yet, and that can only be a testament to the amount they’ve managed to fit into this game in its early phase. I’ve been more of a hermit survivor in most of my playthroughs, going to other islands, hacking down the trees I find and pulling the logs back to my island, diving underwater and looking through the many shipwrecks that pollute the seabed and getting into fights with various sharks when the opportunity arises, which, since the last update, is very frequent and prove to be quite a challenge if you’re ill-equipped. The various ways the game tries to kill you is quite inventive, and to continue your journey of surviving can also lead you to some interesting situations – diving deep underwater while batting off sharks in order to find some antibiotics to cure your sea urchin poisoning, for instance.\\nMore at',\n",

Animals glitch through walls, the controls sometimes don't work and stuff like that. The music is really bad, and there's not a lot to do.

       "  'text': \"Fun combat and a steady flow of rewards make this journey a massively enjoyable one, especially with some fellow mercenaries along for the ride.\\nOn the hostile, bandit-ridden planet of Pandora, there is one thing that draws off-world attention: The Vault. This mysterious alien structure is rumored to hold treasures of fantastic power and wealth, and so it attracts fortune-seeking corporations and individuals alike. In Borderlands, you are one such individual, but the satisfaction of unlocking the Vault's secrets pales in comparison to the rollicking good time you'll have on your way there. Borderlands is all about the journey, not the destination, and like most trips, this one is much better when you have some friends along for the ride. Solo players can still have a good time, because the bloody and entertaining combat is paired well with rewarding loot and engaging experience systems. But Pandora is a lonely place for a solitary mercenary, and lone wolves will find the pace deliberate and the friendly characters too few and far between. Those who take advantage of the four-player online cooperative mode will experience the game as it's meant to be played. The pleasing rhythm of killing enemies, gathering loot, and cashing in is punctuated by fighting bosses, completing quests, and leveling up. As a solo merc, this rhythm is slow and methodical, but as a team, the pace quickens to an invigorating clip and pretty soon you've spent hours having a riotously rewarding time.\\nThe world of Pandora has a dusty, run-down feel, yet it manages to be vibrant and eye-catching at the same time. The art style features black-line borders and a colorful palette that give the game a not-quite-comic, not-quite-cel-shaded look. It takes some getting used to, and its technical execution is less-than-perfect . Yet what Borderlands lacks in precision it more than makes up for in style, and hours into the game you'll still be appreciating the thoughtful design touches that bring this world to life. Though the different environments occasionally feel too similar, there is enough distinct detail to keep them from blurring together. Your vanquished enemies also do their part to keep things visually interesting by dying in a variety of gruesome and entertaining ways. Bodies explode, limbs fly off, and burning enemies occasionally disintegrate from the ground up until only the mask of their face is left hanging in midair. It sounds (and is a bit) horrifying, but when the mask drops comically to the floor and finally burns up, don't bother stifling that chuckle. The art design resonates well with Borderlands' irreverent sense of humor, and the game is playful without feeling too goofy.\\nYou travel through this world as one of four characters, each with a unique look and attitude. You don't really get to appreciate the character designs if you play solo because you have no AI teammates, but you do hear frequent quips that give you a little bit of character-specific flavor. The most important difference between characters is the action skill, which is a special ability that can give you an edge in combat. The Hunter can release a vicious bird of prey, the Soldier can throw down an automatic turret flanked by shields, the Siren can turn invisible and speedy, damaging all enemies in the vicinity, and the Berserker flies into a damage-resistant rage and delivers brutal punches to his enemies. You unlock these abilities after playing for a short while, and not only are they all fun to use, but each one can be customized in a couple of strategically distinct ways. You can tweak and upgrade your ability by investing skill points in appropriate skills. So, for example, upgrading the Hunter's bird of prey not only can increase the amount of damage it does, but can make it attack multiple targets, steal health from them, slow them down for easy sniping, and cause them to drop more loot. Expanding your action skill makes you more deadly in combat, and it's one of the most rewarding parts of leveling up. Killing enemies, finishing quests, and completing in-game bonus challenges earn you experience points, which in turn earn you a new level. Leveling up boosts your overall fortitude and grants you a precious skill point to use however you see fit.\\nYou can also spend your skill points on other improvements, and each character has three different skill trees that highlight different tactics and abilities. So the Soldier can essentially become the team medic by developing the skills that allow him to shoot teammates to regenerate their health and that make his turret create a healing radius. Or he could choose to become more deadly, increasing his turret damage and combat rifle performance. Though your weapon proficiency improves based on how much you use a given weapon type, different characters have skills that favor different types of guns, so it's to your advantage to play to your character's strengths. The Berserker can certainly become proficient with the sniper rifle, but his melee-focused action skill and preference for rocket launchers make him a better choice for wading into the fray. Though the branching skill trees offer intriguing ways to specialize, your initial character choice has the biggest impact on how you'll go through the game. Fortunately, each character is fun and deadly in his own way, so you can't choose poorly, and you'll probably want to experience what each one has to offer. Playing cooperatively allows you to enjoy and benefit from the other characters' abilities, something you don't get to appreciate when playing solo, unless you start a new game.\\nExpanding your abilities and leveling up is one of the main ways that Borderlands consistently rewards you. Loot is another. Loot can be found in containers, dropped by enemies, or given to you as a quest reward. It includes money, ammo, shields, mods that boost and alter your grenades, mods that boost your skills, and, of course, guns. Guns are classified in familiar categories: pistols, submachine guns, shotguns, combat rifles, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, and so on. Each class feels distinct, and the shooting mechanics are well tuned and satisfying, which makes it fun to blast baddies. Base damage, clip size, fire rate, accuracy, and bullet spread are just some of the variables within each class, and some guns have more exotic features, like bladed pistols that increase melee damage or a shotgun that also shoots rockets. They can also do elemental damage, which comes in a variety of flavors that put a special kind of hurt on and can even do damage over time. Equip an incendiary gun if you want to burn flesh, or a corrosive gun if you want to deal extra damage to creatures with tough hides.\\nThe Good\\nSatisfying gunplay\\nTons of weapons, shields, and helpful items\\nFour unique and equally fun-to-play characters\\nDistinct, appealing artistic style\\nGreat system of rewards\\nThe Bad\\nLonelier, slower-paced for a solo player\\nMassively unsatisfying\\nLackluster loot sharing system\\n8.5/10\",\n",

In Ghost Recon you control a squad of 6 or less soldiers, whom can be divided in up to 3 teams. You can build your squad from demolition experts, snipers, support specialists, and if you have completed missions with great zeal, you have access to special soldiers. These units are usually equipped with special weapons and gear (oicw for the win!) and have better stats than your average g.i. Joe. The game contains 15 single players mission in a fictional campaign occurring in east europe, where Nato forces (the good guys) clash with Russian ultranationalists.

They'd spin in circles or sit on top of it.\\n- The menu text is hard to read\\nOverall:\\nShelter was quite an experience.  The graphics and music were absolutely stunning, and the gameplay was a tense battle for survival.  While stressful, the game's style truly won me over.  At roughly an hour of playtime, though, I'm hesitant to fully recommend it.  I, personally, don't think art can fully supplement content enough to warrant a $9.99 pricetag.  That being said, this game is still a masterpiece and should definitely be considered when on sale.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"It's a relatively simple hidden object puzzle game with a scooby doo type mystery as a follow along back drop. Available in three settings, I would just recommend playing it in expert mode from get go, as it will give you a bit more of a challenge, but still not that much. In effect it's just an animated storyboard with some not that complicated puzzles thrown in for good measure. The game in total might take you approx 3 hrs. It's a game suitable for young children and those that like hidden object games which have become so well liked especially among the female gamers. Regardless of it's simplicity and its quirky out of this world subtext, I actually rather enjoyed it, and it was a refreshing break from all those fps that nowadays are so prevalent. If it ever goes on sale and you have children you want to entertain for a couple of hours...get it.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"A visually charming indie pipe-puzzle game that knows how to grind my gears in the least fun ways possible. Clearly an inspired take on a well worn style of puzzler, A Virus Named TOM starts off with a lovely art deco bang that quickly loses steam as you progress. The whole set up--Dr. X, The City of Tomorrow, etc-- oozes charm, and there are plenty of variables and gimmicks introduced to keep things interesting.\\nThe main issue with TOM lies at the very roots of design; instead of challenging you with complex and fascinating puzzles, TOM forces you to combat its own controls and obstacles while solving the base pipe puzzles, which, while initially engaging in the hecticness of the whole thing, suffers from an overload of obstacles while failing to make up for it with interesting overall design.\\nIs the gameplay loop bad in any way? Not exactly. While I lost interest almost immediately, I can't deny that there is a certain draw to find the way through the chaotic mess of some of the harder levels. It's fleshed out in certain areas, yes, but I could never move past the sheer mediocrity of it all. There was heart here, and yet my interest waned the more complex it got. It's just not a fun time, at least not for me.\\nWith all of the flaws to be had, I think there is a lot of talent to be had here. As this is a game from 2012, I can only imagine how far the Misfits have come. I don't doubt that their newer stuff has vastly improved, and look forward to playing them in the future. Nevertheless, VNT wasn't something I enjoyed past the aesthetics. Fun in concept, but in execution? Not so much. From the way Tom controlled to the constant feeling of 'this could be so much more,' A Virus Named TOM fails to impress. Give this one a pass, or at least wait until it's in a bundle or something.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I played Bioshock 2 and Infinite without playing what started it all and I was pretty disappointed that I haven't played this game until now.  Well to break it down, theres the story and the gameplay.\\nThe story is a very, very well done story.  Without spoiling anything, You are playing Jack, a person who was in a plane crash and goes inside a lighthouse and stumbled upon a device where you are taken down into an underwater city called Rapture. The name itself is a contridiction, That's all I can say.  It is a real horror-survival game and even at times made me really scared which most games don't do well. There are voxophones where you can learn more about the rapture citizens which some are very gruesome. Bioshock is also a great looking game for its age.  It utilizes it engine well and looks great.  I enjoy just sightseeing in Rapture because of how dark and dim it looks.  The game is very immersive and puts you in the dark Rapture.\\nNow the gameplay.   Not much to say here though.  You find weapons including a machine gun, a pistol, a shotgun, and other weapons.  You can upgrade these weapons at an upgrade station.  There are a few of them so use them wisely.  The game itself is pretty difficult.  I started on medium then tried hard mode because i prefer beating games on the hardest difficulty and I died so much I had to go back to medium.  I later beat it on hard which was difficult but very satisfying.  Ammo is difficult to find unless you buy it.  The combat is what suffers in this game.  The guns are generic but killing the enemies are enjoyable.  I wish they had the dual plasmid and weapon like bioshock 2.  I tend to use plasmids less because I had to change hand which puts my weapon away, then pick my plasmid, then use it which is slow to use.  The game itself runs smooth and should work with most modern computers.\\nOverall Score.  I think this game is a must.  The story is enthralling, deep, and will put you on the edge of morality.  If you want a great time, buy this game.  The Bioshock series is one of those series you know every single one will be great.  They could not do wrong in this game.  After you are finished, you are wanting more and more from these guys. A game that judges your morality, your humanity, and sometimes your dignity.  People who argue video games aren't art have clearly never played Bioshock.  11/10\",\n",

Seeing your favorite characters in 3D might appease you and the game can also be modded with SweetFX for enhanced graphics.\\nFor the many of you that may like Warriors game to a varying degree, the most important things to address are the combo/combat mechanics, the upgrade system, and the controller problems.\\nCombos are flashy as expected. Attacks are Basic, Ranged (Charge), Special (Musou), Unique (varies based on character), and Kizuna (rage).\\nYou have seemingly one \"Musou\" move except for when you\\'re in Kizuna mode which allows more combos and a Crew based \"Musou\" attack.\\nUpgrading your characters requires both leveling from standard combat/game progress and money, and\\nCompleting certain requirements in each levels will allow you more coins. Some of the objectives require you to earn a certain amount of (!) points from assist kills or Kizuna Rage mode attacks, somewhat like DW8XL Rage mode giving you direct XP drops.\\nMy controller has a DirectInput mode and the game doesn\\'t recognize the trigger buttons. My controller\\'s back button is not recognized (by the Rebind menu at least) even though Windows is able to recognize it\\'s input - I\\'m not sure what that button does.\\nThe March 2017 Humble Monthly bundle is one of the cheapest ways to experiene a Musou game if you have never played one, though I\\'d recommend Dynasty Warriors 8 XLCE above this one anyday.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Finally, a 40k game aside from the Dawn of War series I can rely on to be enjoyable! Lots of replay value in this game, plenty of meaningful progression and one hell of a challenging learning curve. Each race has its own distinct tactical style and you'll have to learn them all back-to-front to consistently defeat them. The models are exceptional, and the game feels truly faithful to the Warhammer 40,000 fluff.\\nA good mix of objective-based gameplay and straight up interstellar slugfests keep things interesting, even in the skirmish mode which seems to be a break from RTS traditions. Skirmish features its own progression system and without any DLC gives you a choice of Imperial Navy, Eldar Corsairs, Ork Pirates and Chaos fleets to play with. You will also often battle against DLC factions such as the Tau Empire and Space Marines without owning those DLCs. Watching an Imperial Fists strike cruiser closing on your little Dauntless light cruisers with naught but violence in mind is certainly tense.\\nThe campaign could use a lot more cinematic flair in my opinion. The focus seems to be very much on the gameplay, with only moderate concessions to cinematic storytelling. While this is definitely not a major issue by any means, I would have liked a little more characterisation and a story that followed specific characters more closely.\\nAll-in-all, I heartily recommend this game to any fans of 40k and strategy games IN SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE! Well worth the original 30 quid price tag, and at half price right now it's a steal.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'One of the classic FPS games that set the new standard in gameplay and graphics in its time.  The jungle scenery and island panoramic views were and still are breathtaking.  The ability to take a different approach to a single situation rather than being led on a rail to each action segment made the game very flexible for many players.  Once you enter the hallways though, the game turns more into a Doom clone where you only have one path to choose and you are faced with a new type of enemy that again evokes memories of Doom.  As a whole the story is interesting and gives you meaning to why you are fighting for your life.  I like your companion that helps you throughout the game to give you directions on where to go and what to do as well as giving background to the storyline.  The storyline consists of your boat, while on vacation, being shot down as you travel near an island.  You recover in the island and start playing cat and mouse to survive only to realize that this was no accident and the crew of your boat were purposely near that island.  But why?  What is so important about THIS island?  Play and find out, definitely a classic for all gamers to experience at least once.',\n",

The game is packed with lots of quirky sidequests though that often go in unexpected and off the wall directions, be sure to pick the Pet Pal ability as being able to talk to animals is a hoot.  The combat in the game is quite difficult so I reccomend saving often, the quicksave system works well so make good use of it when things go pear shaped. There are a lot of complex interactions in the combat sytem with elements playing a huge part. For example you can shoot a barrel of water then cast lightning bolt on it and create a temporary electrified pool of water that will stun enemies in it (And you too, so be careful). Pools of poison explode so creating them and shooting a flaming arrow to create a damaging fireball is another option. There is a lot of variety there so it pays to pay attention to the enviroment and experiment with the various effects. There is a crafting system thats fairly easy to use but has a lot of complex recipes for making anything from weapons and armor to potions, spellbooks and scrolls. All in all this game has a lot going for it and if you can handle the difficulty I strongly reccomend this for any RPG fan.',\n",

No real challenge... or even tower defense.\\nWhere most tower defense makes you think about how best to place towers and what to upgrade when, this game is completely stripped of thought. You learn the optimal locations for each \"tower\" type early on, and, as evidenced by \"hero mode\", the levels are almost all designed with a choke or two that takes full advantage of a single group\\'s optimal patterns, so most levels play like this:\\n1. Plug one, rarely two, \"tower\" groups into obvious optimal\\nlocations\\nOPTIONAL: Spam archers\\n2. Upgrade (Mostly whenever, you\\'ll have plenty of \\'power\\'.)\\n3. WIN\\nThe \"RPG\" side certainly gives math nerds something to obsess over, but it\\'s similarly simplistic:\\n1. Level up!\\n2. Damage +1\\nOPTIONAL: Reset points at any time, because you somehow screwed that up\\nThat\\'s it. You want your healers to heal, of course, (skip Holy Light completely) and to take advantage of each \"tower\\'s\" secondary effects, (armor break, chill, bleed, range, light/blind, devour) but for the most part, you\\'ll just have to decide which usually low-end skill or two to neglect. Usually the lowest. You can safely ignore most defensive skills. (The actual numbers are utterly pointless because adequate info to calculate DPS and some secondary interactions aren\\'t provided, and you learn how effective everything is by \"feel\"/sight same as any TD game anyways... but don\\'t tell the math nerds!)\\nAnd that\\'s the game for you. The art is bland, the story is absurd, but occaisionally amusing. Nothing to see here. While not a \"worst game ever\", if you\\'re out for an actually good tower defense/game, look elsewhere. You might enjoy this if you\\'re a math nerd, part of the Number Enlargement crowd, or just want something easy and amusing to click on and only plan to throw a few hours away with it anyways. Don\\'t expect the game to get better as it goes on, it just doesn\\'t. It never could, because it\\'s fundamentally flawed.\\nUnfortunately, I have to add:\\nThe game runs in Flash/AIR and suffers from the usual \"looks like an old DOS machine could run it/practically requires a super-computer\" issues. On a less powerful CPU, it may take twice as long to get the same amount done, and you will lose input control if you button-mash the one spell you\\'ll want to button mash. But don\\'t worry, you\\'ll only notice it at critical moments, and only cause you to lose your \"perfect\" completion on a couple 45 minute boss battles... before you learn.

It still has hexes, still has one unit per tile; you still have workers to build improvements; still have technologies to research and so on; happiness is now replaced with health and energy instead of money.\\nA bad feature is that the various leaders/civs you are playing competitively against lack personality, which makes it harder to make up your own narrative of your game in your head.\\nThere's lots of little tweaks though like you can store favours from diplomacy now, and there's an orbital layer and miasma on the ground that can hurt you and turns proceed faster maybe due to there being no city states. There's a new feature where you steer yourself towards purity, harmony or um the other one and that gives you bonuses like social policies in civ v and shapes how you can upgrade your units.\\nThere's a new quest system and some requests you to do things but a lot of them seem to basically be a little story attached to a choice of 2 different bonuses.\\nOn the whole it's good if you like civ v and you want more of the same with a few tweaks and a different setting. If it being too close to civ v is going to annoy you then it's probably not for you.\\nIt's also not for you if some rough edges and bugs are going to get on your nerves because there's a few of those to be worked out. In particular the game over screens are very disappointing, and there's no epic wonder building movies.\\nUpdate: I moved towards not liking the game now. It really feels like it was overhyped. The forums are moderated with an iron fist. It seems like they are in semi-seige mode. There has been a lot of criticism.\\nIn the 3 months since launch we have had numerous generous sales and a free weekend but only one patch, which is not good enough.

       "  'text': \"I recommend this to each and everyone of you who likes VN, also I recommend getting the restoration patch, translation is absolutely horrendous so getting the patch is quite helpful, also the patch makes the game *cough* R18+ so there's that.\\nPros:\\n1. Nice slice of life VN that will surely make your heart sprout wings and soar high. (No puns intended)\\n2. 5 Routes\\n3. Very light on your machine that probably even a potato can run it.\\n4. Kotori\\nCons:\\n1. Horrible translation (I recommend getting the patch)\\n2. HORRIBLE TRANSLATION (Seriously the Ageha Route is virtually unreadable)\\nTrust me, the steam version can never compare to the restored version. I would like to thank the awesome people especially FuaNovel who made the restoration patch possible, thanks guys, you're the HERO MoeNovel did not deserve but needed. :')\\nFollow this guide here for the steps in getting the restoration patch:\\nThe road to successfully patching is harsh, and I myself had to do it over and over and over again until I finally got it working, but maybe I was just very unlucky before.\\nNote: Steam won't give you achievements if you patch it so if you want them you'll have to either play normally or skip read the game. Also note that steam won't record your playtime after patching, something to keep in mind, is all.\\nMy personal ranking on the routes:\\nFirst and the best route for me is Kotori!  Kotori is so cute, so VERY cute, she is officially the best girl in the game.  Kotori's ending is very heartwarming as well. I want to thank Pulltop for creating such a beautiful creature.\\nSecond best route for me is Amane's route! Her route is the only one with **spoiler alert**\\nThird best route for me is Ageha's route, because of various reasons such as well.. she's a childhood friend of Aoi. Also, I love how energetic she is. (Edit: I played A Sky Full of Stars too! Hikari and Ageha has the same voice actress!)\\nNow I didn't like that much the twin sisters Yoru and Asa's route, because of various reasons, but there is something nice about Yoru's route ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  (You will know when you get there)\\nNow that I have made my point, I hope that you enjoy the game as much as I did. Remember, Kotori is Waifu, Kotori is Laifu.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Pros:\\n- It is an older game, yet the aesthetics are still quite lovely.\\n- The game runs smoothly with little to no fps dipping on a five-year-old PC.\\n- The crash physics are just so fun. :)\\n- A variety of game modes are linked seamlessly together via the free roam Paradise City.\\n- There is an ever-increasing difficulty curve with vehicle unlocks that make the challenge worthwhile.\\nThe \"OK\":\\n- The AI is decent at what it does, but is also relatively predictable.  Still, it can offer a challenge.\\n-  Online races are enjoyable, but \"Freeburn Online,\" the multiplayer open world environment, has a couple issues.  Most prominently, the games that can be started by the host often require close proximity between players for an enjoyable match to commence, yet a match can be started with players spread out all over the map.\\nCons:\\n- The UI on the PC is a bit rubbish.  The menu is divided into four or five panels that have to be flipped through via the F1 and F2 keys.  There is also very little mouse support.  The \"Easy Drive Menu\" is helpful, but is only intuitive if one has a numpad.  Otherwise, it is a confusing muddle.\\n- The initial controls are ported over from the console version (e.g. \\'Q\\' and \\'A\\' used for accelleration instead of \\'W\\' and \\'S\\').  Those can be modified from one of the menu panels, though.\\n- No windowed mode support.  The only way to run this game in windowed mode (that I know of) is via a third party piece of software.\\n- The store servers are no longer online, making purchase of DLC impossible.\\nOverall, the game is quite enjoyable.  It has a strong single player experience with a decent quantity of online activities.  The dated UI and a few other bothersome features can make it difficult to first get into the game, but they are not annoying enough to dissuade me from recommending the game.',\n",

Another thing is when you die you lose all your stuff and you have to go back to your body to get it before it disappears after a certain time. It kind of reminds me of Ultima Online. Sure it's in EA right now and really needs a ton of optimization, but I would still recommend the game. It's fun!\",\n",

       "  'text': \"My previous review for this game sucked, so I'm re-writing it.\\nI was very excited for this game as I really loved Bioshock, and I couldn't wait to see what this game would deliver. Unfortunately, after playing an 8 hour campaign, despite being somewhat satisfied by it, I felt it was missing a lot in comparison to the original game.\\nI then later found out that Bioshock 2 was developed by another developer (2K Marin) instead of 2K Boston (aka Irrational Games) which is why the immersive storyline like in the first game wasn't there. The multiplayer was developed by another developer, Digital Extremes.\\nBut despite the really interesting storyline being there, the gameplay for Bioshock 2 is great. You play as a big daddy in the year 1970, a prototype big daddy to be exact, and if I remember correctly\\nyou have to go and rescue this girl (not a little sister) as you are apparently the father of the daughter.\\nThe gameplay is very much similar to the first game, you have your weapons, plasmids, health and EVE, but you also have a drill as well as your melee weapon. It runs and feels very much like the first game, but in its own way so it doesn't feel like a completely different game.\\nBioshock 2 also included a multiplayer as well which was, well... Fun, but it could have been a lot better. You had many ways of customising your character, and it also followed a level up system, you could also access your own little apartment to see all your items that you collected too which was cool.\\nThe multiplayer takes place before the fall of rapture, and you could also (the higher you level up) get more backstory for certain characters.\\nFor the most part, the maps were fairly small, and there were many weapons and features to kill your opponents. There were no dedicated servers of course, which meant that everyone had to put up with unreasonable ping.\\nThere were 3 game modes if I remember correctly, team deathmatch, capture the little sister (CTF), and deathmatch?\\nBut unfortunately the multiplayer is now dead as Games For Windows Live is also dead. Not to mention the single player also had GFWL implemented as well. But I think it may have been removed sometime ago. Although it might be alive through programs like Tunngle etc.\\nSo here are two videos if you're curious what the multiplayer was like.\\nOverall, despite the lackluster storyline in comparison to the first game. It's still worth definitely playing this if you're wanting to see the future of Rapture and to find out a bit more about the Bioshock storyline. (Even though it doesn't have much to do with the first game) it's not a bad game by any means, but it could have been a lot better.\",\n",

I love the game though the sotry is good and the game play can feel rewarding. but some parts are just not fair . Like when enemies are patrolling they seem to have 3 unfair phases, they patrol a decent distance first,second They spot you they run foward to thier positions, and then stage three they attack. i only get one phase, other prep my soldiers for incoming attacks or move forward without attacking. i think its just not fair how much of an advantage the aliens have over my team. I dont want to give it a thumbs down cuz the game is pretty amazing. But i dont wanna give it a thumbs up not because i dont recommend it but because some things i feel need to be tweeked. 90% luck 10% skill. not to mention the only strategy you are allowed to have is hope you kill the alien team in one turn. which isnt gunna happen if you are spotted',\n",

I had built a couple of houses and had 6 boxes filled with goods. I thought I was in good shape and I was very confident. I had a weapon that did 24 damage and some leather armor. So thinking I could take on everything I went exploring. Well a chase from a dragon fighting a pack of dire wolves at the same time as a dire bear, dying to have to run so far to get my body. It dawned on me that I was not so ready. I have played this game for about 15 hours and I can say I want  to play many more.\\nPros\\naddicting\\nbig world\\ngathering resources is fun\\ndifficulty seems fair\\ncons\\nnothing really because this is still in alpha\\nthings I would like to see\\nI would love NPCs that you can recruit and have them help you gather or follow and help fight\\nI would like to see some sort of crops that can be farmed\\nI also would like a lot more customization to building. I would like to clear areas and make my own little village.\\nOver all\\nthis is a great game that seems to be on the right path.

       "  'text': \"is a melee focused, narratively driven game with some very lite RPG elements. Now, the game seemingly tries to do way too much and never really succeeds at any of them. But somewhere deep, very deep, in it's bowels lies some potential. Granted, it never shows it itself but you know it's there.\\nThe combat is very simple. It consists of regular attacks, guard breaks, counter attacks and rolls. Technomancy adds a modicum of depth but nothing that'll re-write the book. The roll actually feels a little like the roll in Fable but more loose. Allowing you to roll directly into the backs of enemies from their front. It uses a radial menu to assign certain attacks to shortcuts and to be used directly from as well. Additionally, it can used to have your party members given orders. Though I never found a reason to implement that feature. You can see it's clear inspiration from Of Orcs and Men (same studio) though\\nis much more action-based rather than the active pause with queue mechanics.\\nNow, the environments are relatively plain. Granted, it's a barren desert planet. But the hallways and corridors are extremely closed in -- almost coffin like. I'd like to give the developers the benefit of the doubt being that it takes place on a Mars colony that the quarters would be tight and that that would be more realistic due to money constraints or whatever manufactured lore reason you can come up with but it seems TOO cramped. To the degree where it starts to impede gameplay. The camera is too tight, when evading it's quite easy to become stuck on the geometry. These are things that are easily overlooked IF the rest of the game was truly something to behold. Now, I do still recommend the game on sale when expectations are much lower. Because, as I said, there is\\nhere.\\nThere is also this weird Serum mechanic that acts as an economic barter tool aka money. I suppose the weird part is it also acts as the resource required to craft health packs. It reminded me of the ADAM economy within Rapture.\\nThat\\nI keep mentioning may be nostalgia. This game feels like something from the early aughts. Thematically, it's quite similar to Red Faction or even RAGE. Albeit, it's not a shooter or even as good as either of those.\\nThe game has some very odd voice acting, it's really rough. Personally I think the game may have benefited from being text only. For 2 reasons: It would have allowed more time for the dev team to write better and more diverse dialogue options. Secondly, it would have likely cost a lot less to implement. Since we are here, I'd like to bring attention to the fact that the dialogue options/character interactions that are present sometimes feel very forced or don't represent the paraphrasing regarded in the selection menu. At times they don't seem to have almost any impact aside from a very few more\\nmoments.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"If you're an adult and are looking for immersion and the freedom that comes from a\\nopen world then this is an excellent example. The graphics are superb and the main story line is great, but here's what I found to be one of the best elements of the game. While you play the game, you can acquire various companions (mostly human NPC's). You can have only one with you at any time. The companions are realistically rendered, with convincing facial expressions. Their voices are played by top actors and their scripts are very well written. Each companion has a very personal story to relate in the context of this particularly dark world. Their stories are convincing and believable and often touching.\\nNow their stories are not revealed all at once. Oh no. They reveal it piece by piece as you wonder about the world. They don’t just “tell” you their story, you engage in a conversation with them in the usual way, i.e., with a set of possible choices, and those choices are sensible. I often found myself wanting to respond in a certain way and it turned out to be exactly one of the choices given. Of course, you could be an a-hole if you wanted, and those options are there too. What I liked in this case was that they responded differently depending on how you answered (even if limited, it was convincing to me). As they reveal their story to you, you will likely need to help them (if you want – open world remember). The game keeps a score on how much they like you. It watches your actions and if it’s in line with the companion’s personality then they will like you more, or if not, less. If they reach a certain threshold you engage in an additional dialogue of an ever increasing personal nature.\\nIt was done so well I found just hanging out with my companions and helping them with the tasks they needed doing as well as doing interesting side quests (and there are\\nof them!) more fun and engaging than the actual main story line (which was great)! There was a downside to this though. Once the conversation ended the NPC it became a stupid muted retard – nothing like the “person” you enjoyed talking with. I found myself often considering my actions carefully so as to not annoy them just so I could “wake them up” and get another conversation out of them!\\nI enjoyed the crafting and the building up of various bases in the game, but the interaction with the NPCs was thoroughly engrossing (to me). I’ve played it a total of 149 hours and went through with one faction to the end. Each faction in the game is somehow “twisted” in some why - no one seems truly normal in this game - which is convincing in this case, since everything has gone so far south. Totally a great game in my view with very few irritating aspects (like NPCs stealing your parked armor and moving it! Or running out of carrying space constantly).\",\n",

It's largely more of the same but with better graphics, more augments and slightly improved gameplay. That said, it's a fair bit shorter than HR and I find the story to be worse. They're clearly setting up for another game but it's done in a way that makes the game feel almost unfinished. The game asks more questions than it answers.\\nOther than that, the game plays great and there's more freedom for how you want to play here since the main gripe people had with HR is gone (the unskippable bosses). Overall it's still a great game just not quite as good as HR. I have only played one of Jensen's Stories (Desperate Measures) as I don't have the season pass yet, but it was quite short (about 30 minutes) and very easy even on the highest difficulty.\\nOne thing to note is that the season pass for this game only includes two DLC, and they aren't making more. I don't know how long they are, but considering how short Desparate Measures was I'd be reluctant to pay full price. They're $11.99 individually which is hilariously overpriced, and the season pass is $30 which is a ripoff, especially since all the extra bonus praxis kits, credits, etc. are one time use. If you claim them on one save file, you don't get them on any other. It's a ridiculous business practice and one I hope SE learns from considering all the bad press it caused (rightfully so).\\nOn one last note, this game is kind of...unstable. I had it crash nearly a dozen times in my playthrough, mostly on the loading screens between areas. Make sure you save often and make backup save files if you don't want to be frustrated.\",\n",

So when i finally got a PC i was so happy to see that Supreme Commander 2 was actually on Steam. So i bought the game immediately and i must say this version is literally better in every single way there's a higher unit cap better graphics and a dlc with some very cool structures and units. It also has just about every type of playstyle you could want in a RTS if you're a turtle you can build up your base with a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of turrets then build a bunch of long range artillery and basically strangle your enemy and wait for them to die slowly. On the other hand if you're an extremely aggressive player just build about 6 factorys use your engineers to speed up unit production then swarm the enemy with about 500 units and completely crush them. Or you can build up your defences and get a bunch of research facilities farm research points then get an army of experimental units halfway through the match and take over everything. Or if you prefer a faster playstyle then you can be the aggressive expansionist and spread through the map and take over as much territory as fast as you can and basically just corner the enemy before they can prepare an offensive to stop you. Supreme Commander 2 is probably my favorite RTS of all time and a fantastic addition to any RTS fans library.\",\n",

The mechanics in this game are all extremely shallow and basic.\\n-You can\\'t design your own slime enclosures or customize them beyond upgrades you can buy.  All you can do is build prefab slime cages (and other structures) on plots of land picked by the game.\\n-Way too much unused space in your ranch.  Lots of walking between areas.\\n-Can\\'t breed slimes.\\n-The game descriptions is misleading.  It says: \"You wake at the crack of dawn and get to watering the crops at the ranch. Some slimes are vegetarian, after all. Then it’s time to gather up the plumpest hens from the chicken coop.\"\\nCrops require no watering, no fertilizer, and they replant themselves on their own.  You also do not need to watch after your chickens at all.  They take care of themselves.  You don\\'t even need a chicken coop because chickens will spawn on your farm faster than they can reproduce in the coop to begin with.  There is 0 management involved.  There is hardly anything you need to actually do.\\n-Everything the game requires you to do is repetitive and unchallenging.  You vacuum up slimes.  You don\\'t have to trap them or outsmart them or anything like that.  You can\\'t even fight the ones that are aggressive, aside from hitting them with water.\\n-You interact with everything in the world with your vacuum, which is annoying.  Vacuuming up crops is slow and tedious.  You can\\'t place a stack of ingredients in a container, you have to slowly vacuum them out/in.\\n-Gameplay is just plain annoying.  Slimes and other objects you don\\'t want constantly get sucked into your vacuum.  Hunting slimes is annoying because slimes will transform into hybrids (which cannot be vacuumed up) almost immediately when you enter a new area, so you have to constantly run back and forth between the maps to get slimes right when they spawn.  It doesn\\'t feel immersive at all.  It feels like I\\'m forced to adapt my playstyle to a crappy game mechanic.\\nThe exploration aspect of the game is slightly better than the farming, but the maps aren\\'t that big and only have a few points of interest, and after 7 hours of playing I\\'ve seen and done everything there is to do.  Considering there is no way to further improve my farm - all I can do is continue to feed the slimes and collect their poop - this game does not have much longevity.\\nI understand that this is an early access game, but I doubt any of those features I listed will ever be implemented.  According to the wiki all of the upcoming changes are additional areas and slimes.  I don\\'t think the devs plan to expand the farming aspects of the game, and since this is a farming sim.... I just can\\'t recommend it at this time.',\n",

Although if you want something more focused on battles play Albion Prelude, if you want to build a massive space empire and make the UTF♥♥♥♥♥♥bricks play TC. If you don't own this game you are missing out.\",\n",

Works a lot better and is scarier, in my opinion. However, there are a couple of frustrating bits due to this new system, but you'll never feel like a section is impossible. The puzzles are there, as always, fetching etc. Nothing special but it means there is actually something for you to do, rather than just walking around aimlessly.\\nAtmosphere - Different to the Amnesia games (underwater sci-fi place rather than spooky castle/mansion) and yet scarier. Feels a lot more cold and detached, an uncomfortably new location.\\nAppearance - Wow. The appearance is pretty cool.

       "  'text': 'Might and Magic is a cult Dungeon Crawler series, which got its up and down. The down mostly came after the 7th episode (which was already seriously less good than the 6th).\\nUnlike Dungeon Master (DM) and Legend of Grimrock (LoG), it’s not real-time but turn based. The good point is that it lets you play at your own pace. The down point is that it creates less tension than real time fight and it feels less dynamic. Both can also be seen as advantageous when you just want to relax (although even in turn based game you still can feel pressurized from time to time ! ;-) ).\\nBut there’s also another major difference : M&MX, just like its ancestors, doesn’t feature an unique deep dungeon ; instead, it offers you an open world with numerous small dungeons and a few medium ones.\\nFrom these 2 characteristics, it means there’s no dungeon offering any memorable nor challenging exploration. Once in a dungeon, you’ll never feel lost, and except for a very few exceptions, you won’t even feel confused about what to do or where to go, especially as there’s no puzzle (with a couple of exceptions) and the secrets appear depending of your party abilities and not of your own observation skills. And all that without taking account of the automap.\\nOn another hand, exploring the outside world is more engaging. And the where-to-go challenge comes up when you have to decide what is the next dungeon you want to go. As there’s no level indicator, it means you can end up in a too hard dungeon. This raises another issue:  you can’t play without quick save & load, as it’s impossible to escape a started combat, which is for me a mood killer.\\nBut it’s not that bad, because of another bad point : the game is quickly too easy, which means you’ll rarely have to worry about getting in a too hard fight (if you play in the normal difficulty).\\nThis brings us to the combat system. So it’s turn based. You need 1 or 1 and half healers (because often 1 healer can be paralyzed/asleep/stoned/etc…), and although there’s tank build, there’s no tanking in the way of World of Warcraft (and Dungeon Guardians ;-) ) : there’s no aggro building. You still have a few “attack me during this turn” spells, but most bosses are immune to them, so actually the tank doesn’t need to have much more HP and armor than other party members.\\nThe combats themselves, once you have digested & understood the numerous abilities, are actually simple, easy and mostly straightforward. No, in M&MX, the difficulty comes from the resource management. This means that the difficulty comes from the choice of using or not HP & Mana potions during the fights. Almost no fight can be fatal as long as you have enough potions to go through it. This is even more true as it’s a turn based game, so you have all the time in the world to analyse the current situation and choose the most pertinent ability correctly. So to sail through the game, you just have to understand how much potions you can use in each fight. The number of potions is limited ; you can buy some from shops, but it seems they don’t reappear afterward. But you can also buy limitless rations, that allows you to sleep after the fights to recover all your HP & Mana.\\nAs 1st, you’re short on gold, but after a while, you’ll get a ton of it. So the difficulty comes from resource management, but you get more or less limitless of them after a while ? So yup, there’s not much difficulty anymore after 25% of the game done.\\nThere’s an hard mode, but this one is just too hard to newcomers ; you’re expected to already know the game to pick it (although you aren’t told so in the selection screen), but once you know the game, it is also too easy as you just know how much potions & rations you need to go through the dungeons & world. Plus, still, after a while you just get a ton of money again.\\nThe combats aren’t really boring nor too repetitive, though. There are enough abilities, effect variations, kind of mobs, and special events to keep things interesting. It’s just that without time pressure, there’s not much doubt about what to do, nor doing it quickly enough.\\nSo that’s a bit a pity as the game itself is pretty nice. Discovering & exploring the world and its dungeons is captivating. The character leveling is nicely done (but not great). There’s a ton to do and see, even though the story holds very little interest, which is a bit annoying in a game with such a big world : it builds very little implication in the player, roaming all around, jumping from dungeon to dungeon without caring much about the goals. Ending is nice enough though, as the background of the story is well exploited.\\nThere also are a bunch of riddles in the world, and a few dungeons made of only 1 puzzle to solve and nothing else, plus 1 dungeon made of several puzzles but without any mobs nor real exploration. Puzzles were mostly annoying for me, and I guess riddles are decent if you’re into that kind of thing.\\nVisually, it’s shockingly ugly at 1st ; the 1st city is painfully horrible and technically it feels like we’re back in the early 2000’s. Following cities aren’t much better, but the world and the dungeons are usually well done with a good artistic direction.\\nInteresting combat system plagued by its easiness after a while, simplistic dungeon exploration partly compensated by open world exploration, average puzzles, unequal visuals & atmosphere.\\nSo all in all, this is a game that is bigger than the sums of its parts and offers a nice adventure, despite all its shortcomings.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Just Cause 2 was my first experience with a  \"third-person action shooter\". I enjoyed the quality, the way I describe the game is with the following formula: Skyrim plus Grand Theft Auto multiplied by Explosions/Torgue minus any type of interesting story whatsoever, and let\\'s throw in terrible airplane controls on a keyboard to boot!\\n\\nWelcome to Panau, you are Rico Rodriguez, a spy in the service of the United states. Or as I like to call him \"the stereo typical action hero\". Playing through this game I didn\\'t look at most of the explosions so I did a good job being a badass. As you progress through the story you end up helping three factions lead an uprising in Panau against the current dictator \"Baby\".\\nAs far as \"Just Causes\" go, I wouldn\\'t call this game anywhere near a just cause, the only time that I was impressed with the game was at the end of the main story where the hero does something that I could actually respect and gave a pretty good reason for it. Other then that I heard enough \"Merica!\" \"Because Freedom!\" \"Because secret agents!\" \"Rico do this action hero thing\" \"Uncle Sam\" lines to make me want to eat the American Flag. Because Patriotism!\\nIf I haven\\'t made it clear, I found the story very dull and boring, I was looking forward to finishing the story because then I can free roam all around this massive map and blow stuff up. More on free roaming in the Game Play section!\\nFirst a few notes about the controls. They are a little tricky to get used to, I found myself struggling to figure out what cover I can hide behind, and I would accidently jump out of vehicles or off objects trying to find the right move. This could be mostly to blame for being a Keyboard and mouse gamer.\\nThe strongest controls for the game is the combination of the parachute and grappling hook. There were numerous times that I would shout to my siblings in the other room \"I\\'m spider man with a hang-glider!\" because that\\'s just how the controls felt, but it was very fun and never gets dull soaring around in the sky with the occasional shot to pull me forward.\\nPlease pause for a moment in loving memory of \"Atratzu who tried to fly a plane... and crashed, like several hundred times...\"    Mmmmkay, the controls for the planes are terrible, I crash like it\\'s my job too.\\nOkay now for the quality that made this game shine: Free roaming. I have always loved freedom in a game to do pretty much whatever I want, the story doesn\\'t last very long on this game you can wrap stuff up in a day and have the main story done. to get 100% in the world... I cannot imagine doing it, there\\'s just so much to explore and blow up.\\nThe OCD 100% completionist part of my brain is exploding while I play this game because there\\'s so much to explore, collect, and blow up. I really do love that type of quality in a game, I loved it in skyrim, I love it in Just Cause 2.\\n\\nThe achievements in this game often times require you to do things you wouldn\\'t usually think to do. I never tired to drag someone behind my car with my grapple hook...  or string someone up against a wall and then shoot him to death. So the achievements are dynamic and interesting. But of course there are the standard achievements too: beat the game on this difficulty, do all these quests, complete the story, get 75% completion, etc.\\nJust Cause 2 is $14.99, I\\'ve played a total of 38 hours (as of 09/05/14) that is a very good price, but as always I recommend waiting for the game to go on sale. I bought this game in a humblebundle, the quality is outstanding for the amount I paid. And there\\'s no way I\\'m close to finished with this game. I imagine the game will rack up near to 50+ hours. I intend to come back to it to keep playing over time.\\n\\nI felt like I was in a terrible action movie where everything is over the top, which at first I wanted to call out on the game... but it was doing it on purpose. So why insult something that\\'s trying to be over the top? In the end I fell in love with the game.\\nRegardless of the terrible annoying story (in my opinion, it was terrible and annoying, some people probably loved it and thought it was deep with metaphoric meaning.), sometimes clunky keyboard controls... all the terrible fireball-plane crashes I had... I still will keep coming back for more. I think this game is worth a buy and playing at least for a little bit.\\nThis game is probably best suited for people who like action games of any kind, the 3rd person perspective might catch you by surprise, so don\\'t expect sniping or any scopes: all you have are cross hairs. If you know you like action games, and like free roaming with a parachute and grappling hook, this game is right up your alleyway.\\nEdit/Update 11/12/14 - All achievements earned after playing for about 90 hours.',\n",

       "  'text': \"FTL is an entertaining, very replayable and murderously RNG-dependent roguelike-like. Good for space captain fantasies, even if you will likely be violently disabused of them.\\nYou control a Federation spaceship transporting intelligence that must make its way through sectors of space being chased by the Rebel fleet, for the intel points out their fleet's weaknesses. This plot is lightly described yet more than serviceable - more on this later.\\nGameplay consists of turn-based jumping between FTL beacons and fighting enemies in pausable real-time combat involving charging and aiming weapons & drones, and/or deploying your own crew to board or defend against boarders. There's a fair amount of micromanagement you can do to get the most out of your ship, up to opening and closing individual doors. Ship systems and additional items can be bought & upgraded using scrap metal, which can be found or salvaged from defeated enemies.\\nYou must also manage your fuel supply, as well as missile and drone supplies if you use either of them. If your ship's hull takes enough damage, or your crewmembers die, your game's over.\\nSometimes, multiple-choice events happen - they don't change between playthroughs with the exception of different choices being unlocked with upgraded systems or crewmembers of different species. You might come to remember some of the right choices after encountering them multiple times, but the Advanced Edition seems to add enough events that this isn't as big an issue.\\nYou can also unlock quite a variety of ships between playthroughs, some of which are better than others, but most of which provide new and interesting playstyles.\\nWhile you have a lot of variety between upgrades, as well as offensive and defensive strategies to choose from, apart from your starting equipment you are quite simply more dependent on random chance than usual for a game like this. That means you usually have to work with what you have, and that won't always be enough. This is compounded by the fact that on difficulties above Easy, you receive less resources\\nthe game generates tougher enemies (in exchange for increased score of course). You can and will go from doing pretty well to barely limping along in the space of one jump. The difficulty wouldn't be so bad if you had more of a guarantee of receiving the tools to deal with or run away from it if you need to.\\nWhich is to say nothing of the final boss. It's grossly overpowered and pretty unfair even for a roguelike-like, especially when you never found enough resources to upgrade your systems enough to even stand a chance - or never got the chance to use them to upgrade in the first place because you were taking so much damage. To say nothing of how it turns FTL's metagame on its head with how\\nthe final fight is. With all of this in mind, new players should therefore start on Easy - while I can respect its presence, it's kind of baffling why people thought the game needed a Hard mode in addition to Normal.\\nI think there's a\\nbit of a bright side to the difficulty, though. FTL is not only a quite fun and quite polished game, but a quite involving game, and if you become involved it makes the near-deaths and actual deaths that much more intense. On that note, you can re-name your ship and its crewmembers, and giving them personalized names only adds to the immersion. The touch of the plot is light to allow the players to fill in the gaps with their imagination, and experience their own space adventures. This isn't as much of an advantage when you simply want to win, however.\\nAt least the devs' handling of the Advanced Edition is stellar. It features additional content in almost every area, including events written by Chris Avellone of Fallout fame, and you can even turn the additional content off for the vanilla experience.\\nOf mention is the mod community. The official forums are host to an easy-to-use mod installation tool, and\\nuser-created mods that you can pick & choose from. They range from minor event/cosmetic additions to new ships to entire new campaigns, and can greatly extend the life of the game. Just make sure you're on top of your game and mod updates.\\nIf you like your spaceships and your roguelike-likes, pick this up -\\n- but be prepared to die and die again.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'When Supergiant Games released\\nin August 2011, probably they themselves probably won\\'t have dreamt of the enormous critical acclaim their debut title would get. Seldom has an independent developer hit the gaming scene with such an original and beautiful game as in this case.\\nWhen I started\\nfor the first time, I immediately got the feeling I was in for a special treat. Few games begins as arrestingly as this one, with the whiskey- and smoke-weathered voice of the \"narrator\" immediately setting the scene. This narrative aspect proved crucial in the way\\ndrawed me into its world. It seemed like every step I made or every action I tried, could be met with some commentary. This feeling that the story develops \"on the spot\" is further enhanced by the fact that the world literally materialised under my feet as I ventured further out. This world is painted in bright and gorgeous colours with a teint all of their own:\\nwould be immediately recognizable just by looking at the colour-pallette.\\nThe story by itself proved interesting enough to keep me playing, wanting to discover step-by-step how things would develop with the Bastion and the protagonists. Gameplay-wise,\\nis not as innovative as in its storytelling or visuals, but it takes a well-tried formula into perfection. At its core, it is an action-rpg (light), preferably to be played with an xbox 360 controller (as are so many games the past years!). Controls are perfectly laid out and very intuitive: after a couple of hours I played it as if I had done so for several years. As the game progresses, more weapons and special abilities are unlocked, all with their distinctive characteristics. Weapons can be upgraded in five stages each, and liquids add some punch to the main-characters possibilities. Several other elements complement this core gameplay so that there is always enough variety to keep things interested. I even signed up immediately for the \"new game plus\" mode after completing the game a first time, looking forward to more unlocks of different sorts.\\nAnother department where\\ntruly shines, is its soudtrack. Seldom has ingame-music helped me so much in getting \"into\" the game, as it captures the mood of every level to perfection. Combined with the unique grain of the narrator\\'s voice, this develops into a great listening experience. The developers also did a wonderful jobs in the myriad of smaller sounds present in the game: every weapon for example has a unique \"ring\" to it, from the zippy sound of the Breaker\\'s Bow to the rusty clack of the Musket. There really is no weak link in this game. Everything is extremely well thought-off, and even better implemented. It\\'s a must-play for everyone who loves pc gaming.\\nGameplay: 27/30\\nGraphics: 18/20\\nSound: 10/10 (maybe the best of all elements in this game)\\nLongelivety: 8/10 (I played it for over 25 hours, exploring it to the full)\\nTechnical: 10/10 (no issues whatsoever)\\nSteam-integration: 8/10 (trading cards, leaderbords and achievements included, the latter good but not special)\\nPersonal appreciation: 9/10\\nOverall: 90/100\\nI completely love\\nand recommend it emphatically. Since I started writing reviews of the games I play on Steam almost a year ago, this is the first game that gets a score in the 90\\'s - I don\\'t want to ruin my scoring-system with giving too many high-scores. But this one deserves it to the full.',\n",

If only they had spent more time, or money, or effort, or whatever it took, to make it look and play better.  The graphics look like the game should be running on Windows 98, and the combat consists of just click MOUSE1 until you die, or the thing you are fighting dies.  It does a decent job of atmosphere, but just like anything else (this game especially), once you see the monster you are so afraid of, the magic is lost.  I lost interest very quickly playing this due to poor combat design and poor graphics (and this is coming from a guy who loves games like Dungeons of Dredmor).  Do not waste you hard earned dollars buying this game.  While the idea is there, it was executed so poorly.  Maybe the minds that made it will get another shot at making something with a little more polish.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"In Long Live The Queen you play as Princes Elodie, the incoming Queen. It is up to you to ensure that the Princess lives to be crowned Queen.\\nThe game works on a weekly cycle. At the start of every week you will be required to choose two classes in which Elodie will participate. These classes will determine which skills are increased. It is important to note the Elodie's mood, as her mood will determine the bonus or penalty to learning skills. For example, if Elodie is depressed, she will not be very fond of attending a class on court manners, hence, that skill will receive a penalty, and spending time on it will not result in any meaningful increases.\\nOn the weekend, you are given the choice of a weekend activity, which will determine changes to Elodie's mood.\\nInterspersed are events that require Elodie's skills to be of a certain level in order to be successful, and if not, a negative outcome results. These events give life to the story, and illuminate the intrigue of Nova and its people: noble, commoners, and criminals alike.\\nThe gameplay can be rather formulaic, however, the beauty and tactical reasoning arises when determining the combinations of skills that will keep you alive, and keep your realm and people safe.\\nThe magic of the game is found in honing one's skills of forecasting and strategy. Seems like tensions in the realm are rising? Do I prepare for war or hope for the best? These are some of the questions that may need answers as you play, knowing that the wrong decision could very well prove fatal.\\nIt is a perfect Groundhog Day scenario to experiment with choices and their ramifications.\\nVisually, it has an anime-esque appeal, but one wishes for a greater variety of scenes and backgrounds. The outfits, which are unlocked by increasing skills in the same branch, are very well designed and emphasise Elodie's demeanour and personality.\\nI highly recommend Long Live The Queen for players interested in a strategy game with flair.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Man there are so many things about this game that are quite good.\\nFor the most part the gameplay is great - it's purely based on logical deduction & most of the contradictions aren't that hard to find; there's one or two based exclusively on gameplay footage much earlier from the game that you probably wouldn't remember or rewatch to see, which is a bit unfortunate, and one or two that only vaguely tie together nicely, but the majority make sense and it makes the gameplay experience feel really organic, there's not really a lot of handholding (unless you want it, as the game does provide a system to give you hints should you need it. My only other gripe is that there is the occasional moment where you just have to wander around until you trigger a cutscene & the game gives you no indication you can't progress until doing so but it is kind of predictive of player actions, not knowing what to do leads to wandering and inevitably to finding the solution you need, so, fair enough there.\\nThe story itself is really engaging too, dealing with some... weird stuff for sure, though unfortunately leaves a few too many loose ends dangling for my liking - the game ends just with solving the mystery of the murder while many other plot points go unresolved. I know the developer plans for a sequel but I don't feel it's reasonable to leave these plot points hanging, at least a few of them felt pretty major. But in general the atmosphere is great and the story keeps you interested.\\nPresentation wise... okay maybe this is on me but the video was very glitchy the whole way through, though other than being a bit distracting at times it didn't really have a major impact on the gameplay itself. And the acting is all pretty solid, though one characters' audio quality felt really off. The UIs are all pretty basic but work well enough too and the music keeps the atmosphere feeling tense.\\nFor the price the story is fairly reasonable in length too - I spent around 10 hours though a bit of that was spent idling doing other things, and someone picking up on the clues a bit faster could cut that down even more so, something like 8-12 hours depening on the type of player you are I guess (and if you don't use cheats which I never did). Replayability is fairly low though.\\nAll around a great package though & I'd definitely be looking forward to a sequel, if one of those ever gets made.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Do you like racing games where you get to shoot guns? How about running over hordes of squishy enemies? You can do both these things in Zombie Driver HD. This is the re-release of a 2009 game with improved graphics and additional content, and while the game seems to have mediocre meta ratings, the user review scores on Steam are very positive (in the 90’s). The game was released on consoles like Xbox 360 and Playstation 3, but the Steam version seems to have a lot more achievements than the console ones (more than 100).\\nThe game’s story is actually very rudimentary, where all you know is that some sort of disaster has occurred, creating zombies all over the city. The opening and closing animations are like motion comics, where they just kind of zoom around on a single painting (not really movies). This means that you mostly pick up the plot from the intros to each level, where your commanding officer gives you your orders. It’s worth noting here that the voice acting is pretty bad, and has some grammatical errors and misplaced emphases. It’s not that big a deal since the game is mostly zombie squishing, and the story is just for adding flavor.\\nZombie Driver is a top down car shooter where you drive around a large city map infested with thousands of zombies. There are about 30 levels in total, and the game “world” resets between each mission so you can grind for money or achievements if you want. There are only 4 different types of weapon (machine gun, flame thrower, rocket launcher, and rail gun) and the ammo is scarce enough that you can’t just drive around firing wildly. Fortunately, most of your kills will probably be from squashing ♥♥♥♥♥es with your ride. Things like ammunition and repair kits respawn every few minutes so if you take your time, the game is actually pretty easy. There’s no way to change the difficulty, by the way. By completing side objectives during certain missions, you can unlock different cars to drive, each with different stats for speed, armor, and ramming power. If you have the DLC, the best car for most of the game is the Auroch truck. Vehicle upgrades are separate for each car, so you don’t want to spend all your money upgrading your early cars, but the weapon unlocks/upgrades carry over for all cars.\\nAs for the enemies you’ll be facing, most of them are weak shambling zombies that barely slow you down as you trample over them, but after the first few missions you’ll meet the guy that makes you drive cautiously all the way to the end of the game – the exploding fat zombie. He’s pretty much the only enemy you try not to run over, and this prevents you from just holding down the nitro and boosting around the map. There are also a few bosses to fight, but they’re basically all the same in gameplay (rooted to the ground throwing stuff at you). Since health and ammo pickups respawn on the map, you can use hit and run tactics on bosses, and run away to heal if you’re about to die.\\nPros:\\n+Very nice gruesome graphics for such a small game. I think it was about 1gb to download.\\n+Fun for casual zombie squashing, and if you want, you can replay levels you’ve already beaten (but these don’t “save” meaning your main campaign save file doesn’t keep the money found or cars unlocked from level replays). That means the only real reason to replay levels is to unlock achievements.\\n+I enjoy games where you can (but don’t have to) grind for money to buy persistent upgrades. I originally thought this game was like the Alien Shooter / Zombie Shooter games, and it kind of is similar in the way you take extra time on each level just to look for extra money to buy upgrades.\\nCons:\\n-The game gets repetitive by the middle of the campaign. Every mission is basically the same (clear out the zombies in a particular area) and it all takes place on the same map. The enemies don’t get any stronger, just more numerous. At least the map is big and you’re constantly upgrading your cars.\\n-The game camera swings wildly at times since it seems to be on a slight delay. This means you can do a sharp skidding turn, and a second later the camera rotates 180 degrees. I didn’t get a headache playing the game, but I can see how it would bother some players. There’s also a bug (possibly intentional) where it’s possible for you to get “stuck” on certain obstructions. Despite being a top down game, you can still make small jumps if you’re going fast enough (like hitting a wall at full turbo speed). This means once in a while you’ll get stuck on a wall or a fence and need to restart the level. It’s really annoying if you’ve already completed the mission objectives and are just running around looking for money before ending the stage, suddenly you get stuck and have to start all over again.\\n-The “story” is pretty generic and predictable, so don’t play it for the story.\\nOverall Zombie Driver HD is a great game if you enjoy top down shooters and mowing down massive hordes of weak enemies. Seriously, by the last level you probably can’t go half a screen without running over a dozen zombies. If you’re just playing for the Steam achievements, I can tell you that about half of them are pretty easy to acquire, but the other half require a lot of grinding (kill 10,000 zombies each with machine gun/rockets/fire, etc.).  If you have half an hour to kill (literally), you can beat one story mission at a time until you finish the campaign and move on to the other 2 game modes: Blood Race and Slaughter. Blood Race is an actual racing mode, unlike the main game where it’s just you vs zombies. Think of it as a top down version of Rage racing, with machine guns and missiles. Slaughter mode is a survival game where you try to live through rounds against increasingly dangerous waves of zombies (more fat exploders).',\n",

You will find yourself whether it be on king of the hill, or a roleplay server (most of my time is into those) in a hole pinned down by a sniper, a bunch of guns, or a scary♥♥♥♥♥tank with no ammo left.\\nPRO---The fun part of this game is the amount of creativeness you have especially on roleplay servers which are the most fun for those with mics. It's so fun to mess with those in game and play weird voices or act like a nut.\\nCON/PRO---The controls are extremely confusing i will admit and you need a good 3 hours to learn them and configure them so you can quickly access the stanses you need to shoot someone. But even with the over 50 different combinations you learn them and it makes things alot easier once you remember them.\\n2----SERVERS\\nPRO---- I am glad to say you can still find a good number of servers still in the best filters but it's not as alive as it used to be. Roleplay used to be the biggest of em all and i've been an admin for plenty of em and gone and done police and started large gangs, all the above. but that's harder to do nowadays and you need someone to teach you how to play in them since theya re so complex now.\\nCON----You are probably not going to find what you are wanting to. You will not find a server like PSI's where the RP is great and everyone is there to have fun and make memorable moments. However that still happens, but in servers like olympus and asylum, you have the big try hard gangs of which try to get around the server rule loop holes and break that rp. I find myself playing king of the hill more than RP now especially after A3L got shut down.\\nYou have missed this game's golden age but you can still find plentyof fun in it with the workshop and with a group of friends. HOWEVER, I do not reccomend this game for someone who does not have alot of time, who is not into complex combinations and having many of them, and looking for a youtube Arma 3 expirenece.\\nBut it is still pretty fun.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Really hard to stop playing this!\\n...and now for a more in depth review.  But you have to forgive me.  When I wrote the previous sentence as my review (albeit a very short review) I had been playing this game nonstop since buying it until 4 in the morning.  Good thing it was Saturday night when I bought it!\\nSo what is this game?  It is a cross between a physics-based racing game where the player NEVER gets to drive a car, and an economics sim where sponsors just want to see their name out on the track somewhere - anywhere, but preferably on the winning car, and a personality simulator where your boss and the mechanics and the drivers love you or hate you based on the decisions you make.\\nIs it worth well over $20?  Well yes.  The graphics, even on my crappy laptop, are quite nice, and the UIs are laid out well.  The game sort of \"flows\" - you don\\'t have to think too much what you were supposed to do because it brings everything into the forground in a very intuitive way.\\nBut who cares?  I mean if you have a great UI and game flow but the gameplay isn\\'t compelling, why bother?  And here is where the game is wildly addictive - because the game is a CLIFFHANGER.  There\\'s no better word for it.  You\\'re 26 laps into a 28 lap race, the finish line is oh so close and the tires are just about worn out and fuel tank almost empty, and the car\\'s driver pipes up over the microphone \"hey my oil change light just came on!  This car needs Jiffy-Lube right now!  Do you want me to quit the race and come in and eat an ice cream cone while I wait for an oil change?\"\\nGod are you daft - NO!!!  Then for the next 2 laps he squawks that the engine could BLOW UP at any second, and he has a good point, but that\\'s just the risk we have to take when trying to finish - let alone win.\\nRaces are time consuming - preparing for them just as time consuming.  It\\'s a hard uphill climb, tweaking every little parameter.  And the drivers don\\'t know how to explain themselves beyond \"I don\\'t like how it handles.\"  Well duh.  Could you be more descriptive?  Does it need more toe in or more toe out?  \"Na - just don\\'t feel right to me.\"  Yes well thank you Mr. Neanderthal.  I\\'ll get on that pronto!  It\\'s just like... like... REAL LIFE!\\nThe drivers\\' inability to help troubleshoot tuning the vehicle makes it just that more satisfying when all the tweaking finally results in a happy driver and all those smiley faces.  Because we somehow managed to change driver\\'s diapers and they be happy driving tringaling down the race track.  Yes you are such a good driver!\\nThen there\\'s tire wear management and fuel and sponsors and the freaking grounds construction.  Yes we need a wind tunnel but we can\\'t quite afford it right now and an on-grounds race track would be nice but we\\'ll have to make due with tuning the car just once before quailfying and my boss doesn\\'t want me spending money on better car parts and one of the drivers is jealous I gave better brakes to the other driver\\'s car!\\nThe core game is the race itself - but there is so much more going on that this game becomes a very grand and satisfying experience.  I haven\\'t even got 10 hours of play in!\\nReally the only thing to worry about is not \"will I get my money\\'s worth\" - no the only thing to worry about is \"will I lose all my friends because I really don\\'t want to do anything than play just one more race on Motorsport Manager.\"  Yes.  Tough decision.  :)\\n----------------------\\n--- Update ---\\nCon:\\nThe worst part of the game is that it drags on too long.  Some people have complained that they would like to be able to compress the real races into a simulation (which practice and qualifying races offer - so it\\'s already in the game engine).  I have to agree.  Spending 20 minutes watching a race I\\'m already not interested in because the whole setup is still in the ramping up phase is annoying, and it happens at the beginning of the game, so that\\'s pretty frustrating.\\nBecause the game is so time consuming, starting over at a different difficulty because tedious, though the challenge is compelling.  Still - the amount of time this game takes up is unnecessary and detracts from the fun.  It\\'s like the developers intentially added a time sink (somewhat compensated by the ability to reduce laps, but even at the minimum this is not enough).\\nPro:\\nConversely, the food for thought this game provides for management, team building, budgetting and tactics is an experience I would recommend for anyone.  There are concepts for team management which I have never seen brought into play in any other game before I played this, and it is a mind-openning experience.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Disclaimer: I was generously given a free copy of Detour with the understanding that I was expected to review the title after spending some time with it.\\nDetour is a puzzle game which tasks you with creating a safe route for a truck to pass through a hostile city.\\nNow the bad part. This game runs atrociously. The first thing that struck me when starting up the game for the first time is the inexcusable amount of latency when using the software cursor. The delay between my mouse movement and the cursors response on the screen varied anywhere from 0.5 to (not exaggerating) 2.5 seconds! If you’re really desperate to play Detour, your first priority should be to enable Hardware Cursor in the options menu. Following the debacle with the laggy mouse, I noticed there were a fair few grammatical issues with the level selection text. Typically with low budget/hobby games I sort of just overlook this, especially when the narrative is, for all intents and purposes, irrelevant to the actual gameplay. Unfortunately, after seeing the issues with the cursor, these errors were much more eye catching and set a precedent in my mind that this was either shoddily put together or unnecessarily rushed to release. Then I began the campaign. I actually quit midway through the first level just to activate Steams’ FPS counter and boot up Fraps to confirm my suspicions: this isometric mobile-port style puzzle game was running at 16 FPS on a GTX 680 and an overclocked i7-2600k. I suffered on through a handful more levels just to know what the game was trying to be, and as intriguing as the concept may be, the performance of this game is just abysmal.',\n",

If you played the first one this one is very similar. Yes, the different vehicles add more variety to the game, but it's still all about collecting stars, letters and other collectibles, while performing as many stunts as you can. Except this time, the whole game is set on a movie set. Even the graphics look the same, with just slightly more variation.\\nAlso, the game performs much, much better than the first one. The first one had some annoying frame drops, but JD2 runs at a solid 60FPS at all times. But this Joe occasionally has some frustrating levels with not enough checkpoints.\\nIn the end Joe Danger 2 still isn't very long if you don't like to collect stuff, but if you do you're in for a treat. It's a great game, just don't expect too much new stuff. However, if it's your first Joe you have nothing to worry about. Just enjoy the ride !\\n[Rating: 77/100]\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Wanted to like this game, and gave it every chance in the book, but it constantly shot itself in the foot with terrible and repetitive level design, poor platforming mechanics, and bad game design decisions. Lets start with good like always. The game works for the most part, with only a few bugs encountered. It kind of reminds you of old NES platformers, and mario that it clearly rips off. Also there are many secrets to be found most levels and alternate routes to uncover. Then there is the bad. People are right the games hitboxes are some of the worst I've ever seen in a platformer, I've jumped on people and been killed by them so many times it's ridiculous. Someone pointed out how stupid the game design is in the fact that if you die and still have lives left, you begin with nothing you had at the start of the last life, which is super stupid and no other games does. Why would he think that was a good idea. So you just kill yourself to get back to your first life, because you want your power ups. This wastes time and makes no more than 1 life worthwhile. There are basically 2 powerups, a shield and shooting fireballs, thats it the entire game, which is super boring and uninspiring. Then there are the gameplay mechanics. The running and jumping doesn't work half the time, if you try it on a short length platforms for some reason it doesn't read it sometimes and you just jump half way. Other times it won't read you jumping even though you press it before you are off. Other times on the moving tiles you will press it perfectly and once again you won't jump...herp derp. It is almost like there is too much of a delay. On the moving platforms you will press it right away and it still won't read it. Sometimes when you land on platforms you slide, dont ask me why. The worst part is the game level design. Where as mario has interesting levels with varying things like pipes and riding♥♥♥♥♥♥and different levels of things to jump on, 8 bit has the same levels and they are dumb. They are all basically levels 2/3 of it with fire/water/spike that are instant kills, and you just jump onto single little platforms. This is stupid for many reasons. First off my having every level be mostly instadeath, with no checkpoints, all of your powerups you got are usually worthless because you just die and at any time if the game mechanics don't hold up, and you restart the level. Mario didn't do this, it had flat surfac levels because people don't want to have to jump over level every 2 seconds. Also by making every platform just single platforms it artifically raises difficulty and is just sloppy design. Mario and other platformers aren't all just single jumps over lava. Could have spent time and been inventive instead of making the same level. The final boss is stupid as you can't get any powerups and have to go through these 3 different attacking forms before you can hit her once, and you have to do that at least 4 or more times. If you get hit once its all over and you have to redo it all. Not worth my time. Just not that good of a platformer, obsessed with instant death and single platforms, and the wonky mechanics and hitboxes make it more frustating than fun that you have to restart levels over and over when its not your fault. 4.5/10\",\n",

       "  'text': '\"Reckoning up the sum, the best was yet to come, for the end of part one seemed a little too coarse. To amend we\\'ll send Rufus to attend a second chance for a decent happy-ending: a grand fling with dancing and booze and so forth...\"\\nTo put it simply, if you liked Deponia, you\\'ll certainly like Chaos on Deponia. Part of that\\'s because it has just as much quality in its art, characters, story, music, puzzles, etc. The other part is because it more or less follows the same motions. Rufus solves an enclosed introductory puzzle, then builds a contraption involving rockets to launch himself into the sky, winds up crashing into a vehicle which contains Goal, both plummet to Deponia, you solve a handful of major problems by solving a ton of smaller ones in a large town area, then a smaller transitional act, and finally the twisty confrontation.\\nAnd yet, despite featuring the same framework, the body is all-new. New faces, new locations, new puzzles. There\\'s much to do and explore. So much of the world of Deponia to learn about, and a diverse and creative cast of characters to meet, all weird in their own ways.\\nAnd oh my god, the voices are so much better. I mean, the majority of Deponia\\'s voices weren\\'t a problem, but the Organon\\'s certainly were. Luckily, though the voices still have the same electronic filter, the volume has been turned down from \"standing beside a malfunctioning stage woofer\" to \"playing on a rusty seesaw\". I never liked Goal or Toni\\'s voices much in Deponia, either, but unless I\\'m less of a cranky old voice snob than I used to be (unlikely - I\\'ll be a voice snob \\'til the very end!), the actresses have gotten a better hang of their characters, this time around. Goal, in particular, I thought sounded very nice. And she\\'d have to, considering the actress now had to keep up with three or four variations of the character (each of which sounds distinct, but intentionally similar enough to be the same character). Rufus does sometimes have lines that are delivered in ways that don\\'t seem to match the situation at hand, and I definitely caught a flubbed line here or there (which the subtitles at least got right), but even still, his V.A. does a fine job with the other 98% of his lines.\\nWeird translation problems do crop up from time to time, and they can have varying impacts. Chaos on Deponia was made by a German team, and it seems a little obvious here and there. For the mostpart it doesn\\'t matter at all. On the whole, the English version of Chaos on Deponia shows an expansive understanding of the language. But there are some lines that just didn\\'t make it through unscathed (at one point, a character asks, \"What? I\\'m pardoned?\" when he\\'s supposed to say, \"What?\\npardoned?\"), and some jokes seem weird in ways that suggest that they worked a lot better in their original language.\\nOn that note, I also want to mention that Poki\\'s folky narrative songs are more... chaotic, this time around. Maybe that was a thematic choice, based on the title. But I\\'ll be honest, those songs were one of my absolute favorite parts of Deponia. With maybe the exception of the third song, in this game they\\'re much harder to follow. If it weren\\'t for the subtitles, I wouldn\\'t have a clue what he\\'s saying half the time, with odd rhymes, lines with way too many words, and lines that end in the middles of words. I suppose this adds to the zaniness in a way, but I still preferred the old ones better.\\nThe puzzles are more imaginative than I had expected, even having played the first game. Where Deponia featured a borderline obsessive number of puzzles centered around washing things, the devs have put forth a much stronger effort to keep you one your toes, this time. There are some dips into moon logic territory, but even those are more to do with the problem presented (such as as a head-sized human nose sticking out of a wall as a security device), or with how extravagant the means to solving them are (the lengths Rufus goes to in order to recognize a cat door are astounding, and perhaps a little unfortunate depending on your affinity for cartoon wildlife), and maybe one or two where I wasn\\'t sure what I was accomplishing until I had already accomplished it (ding-dong ditch comes to mind), rather than just a straight-up complete and utter lack of logic. Several puzzles are downright ingenious, though. One puzzle involving a secret knock is about as weirdly outside-the-box as it gets, and I love it in all of its fourth wall-breaking splendor.\\nDaedalus has struck a good balance in the difficulty. It\\'s not as though I never got stuck. I did. In fact, I got stuck on the follow-up to that knocking puzzle simply due to a confusing sound effect. You have multiple secrets knocks which, though they should all sound different, all use the same sound effect, which made it tough to figure out how I was meant to go about solving the problem. But the vast majority of them were a joy to solve, with the game giving you just the right amount of clues necessary to understand what you\\'re doing, without being so simplistic as to make you feel like a toddler. And there are a number of segments which take chances and break out of the typical talk to people/use items mold. You\\'ll play an interesting take on a fighting game, compete in the weirdest form of rock-paper-scissors that I have ever seen, and take advantage of a complicated loophole in fast food pricing, among other highlights.\\nThe puzzles are good, I like the puzzles. They\\'re not 100% perfect but they\\'re like 80-90% perfect. Boom, could have saved you two paragraphs of your time if I\\'d just written that first.\\nI said it about Deponia, and I\\'ll say it again about Chaos on Deponia: the game feels like a true evolution of the old SCUMM-based Lucasarts games. Not a copy, nor even an homage. But something which could have naturally formed from Lucasarts themselves in an alternate timeline. I mean this as a great compliment. If you can stand some translational oddities, you\\'ll find that Chaos on Deponia is a beautiful - albeit junk-strewn - world filled with strange people and creative solutions for even more creative problems. I can easily recommend picking it up. Though I of course recommend picking up Deponia, first, if you haven\\'t. Or the recently released Complete Journey which collects the whole trilogy. If you\\'re a fan of silly, imaginative adventures like Day of the Tentacle or cartoony ones like Curse of Monkey Island, you\\'re in for a treat with these.\\n\"HUZZAH, PUT BALLS TO THE WALL!\"',\n",

It has to be one of my favourite games of all time.  The story is engaging and even for someone who hadn't played past the first boss of Borderlands 2 before playing this game, I enjoyed it so much that I just ended up finishing Borderlands 2, purchasing the Pre-Sequel and completing it too.  So yes, this game is also a great introduction to the whacky Borderlands Universe.\\nSo many references to movies and other games as well.  Like I said, I really recommend playing it.  If you are short on cash, wait until it's on sale.  But unlike a fair few other games, I really think this game is good enough at full price.  The less you know about the game going into it, the better.  I hadn't watched any gameplay or even trailers of this game before I started it, I just knew I had loved previous telltale releases and a few friends had told me to play this.

       "  'text': \"where to begin with undertale. this game was arguably the most loved indie title of 2015, but why is this? people go on and on about how amazing the world and characters of this game are, and while yes i agree that some of these characters are interesting, i must say that the majority of our plot characters simply feel as if they are just there to give us dialogue. the game's combat system is praised for its intrigue and how it seperates itself from traditional JRPG standards, but when you take a look at what is really in front of you, you can see that what is presented is not fun. no were in my JRPG's would i want to start playing a platformer or a bullet hel or what have you. my biggest issue with this game is how you are presented with what seems like a traditiona; JRPG set up, and the opening feels nice, it feels like im playing and old SNES game, but then you start to discover how the game and its developer like to force messages down your throat. this game is touted as, and is presented as a traditional JRPG style game, but when you go and play the game as presented, the developer says no, ♥♥♥♥ you, here's a permenantly corrupted save file for you so you can never get the good ending ever again, this basically limits you and forces you to do a pacifist or neutral run your first time through unless you are ok with forever being a murderous character in every and all subsequent playthroughs. all in all, undertale was an overhyped, but severely disappointing and gross game. no matter what your friends say, no matter what reviewers say, if you are wanting to learn more about this game, do not go in blind, do research, please do it and save yourself some money if you can, i can not recommend this game to anyone.\",\n",

So I bought it in early access, (actually bought it twice since I got a copy for a friend) at the time the game was fairly bare bones and short and the combate was okay but felt lacking. Since then the game is come out and has made major inprovements combat has been refined and tweaked and feels good overall characters now have better ranged attacks, light and heavy attack combos and special attacks. However there are still a few bugs and possibly needing a few changes like counters being replaced with a block of some kind and some kind of targeting system wouldn\\'t hurt.\\nThe game is fun, but fairly short and currently lives on it\\'s replay value with leveling up characters, trying different skill sets and raising \"hunter ranks\" I\\'ve put in a good 30 hours into the game and feel I\\'ve gotten my moneys worth out of it. However with the current price set at 25 dollars and with a fairly short story mode and the miscomunication over the games coming DLC with added character that\\'s left many people feeling angry and confused, it\\'s hard to reccomend the game at full price.

The blocking system can be dumb and not work if you use mouse. Most people will just come at you in a mid 1 v 1 to get a kill, then they get revenge, and you both die. Dosen't help you can parry everythinggggggggg. It gets boring constanly parrying or being parried. Game also lacks different outfit options.

For one, I can appreciate any 2D platformer that has the decency to give you a \"save anywhere\" feature. Mario and Metroid, while fun can be very tiring after playing the same part of a level over and over and LOVE totally cuts that out. I love it. Thank you.\\nHowever, there isn\\'t a whole lot to recommend beyond the save-anywhere feature. You run and jump. You avoid obstacles in well-designed levels. And that\\'s it. Granted, there are changes to gameplay and obstacles but they\\'re so short that you don\\'t get a feeling of actually mastering them, like in Mario or Metroid.\\nThat and the fact that the game has 16 levels (well, technically a lot more with the remix mode), despite the changes in speedrun mode and hard mode... there isn\\'t much to LOVE to really find anything special in. Similar to \"You Have to Win the Game\", LOVE does has smooth controls, a nice graphical aesthetic, and a great difficulty and save feature, but it\\'s so samey and safe that it\\'s just not something you\\'ll want to go back and play in a while. Or at least I don\\'t.\\nIf you like a fun 2D Platformer, LOVE certainly is that. But beyond the simple mechanics, it\\'s not a particularly memorable experience. I\\'m giving it a 6/10.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Even bigger RNG fest than Curvestone because you have 75 cards in decks (with up to 4 copies of the same card), so your draws are VERY inconsistent.\\nMore often than not you are left with either excess sigils (i.e. lands from MtG) or creatures/weapons/spells you can\\'t play because you didn\\'t draw sigils to do that.\\nBecause of the two reasons above most of the people play aggro decks where many of the cards cost 3 or less. Imagine a game where everyone is playing small creatures and hits face... pretty sad.\\nAnother bad thing about this game is that there are no comebacks at all: if one of the players is winning, he\\'s winning by a lot.\\nGranted, the developers are trying to fix this by changing the redraw mechanics (didn\\'t help because you can\\'t redraw a single card, you either keep your whole hand or discard all of the cards) and by introducing weekly quests when you have to win with a predefined deck that is not aggro. But again, the outcome of the matches is so dependent on what you draw, it\\'s not fun even to win as you know your skill has little to do with that. And losing to ideal top decks made by your opponent is even more frustrating than in Curvestone.\\nThere were games I couldn\\'t play anything by turn 6 because i got a bad hand, and after redrawing still got only 6+ cost cards and sigils. And playing against aggro decks that means you are dead.\\nOn a good side, there\\'s also a mode (similar to HS\\'s arena) where you make a deck from random cards. And this mode is actually much better than ranking because you have only 30 cards in the deck so your draws are much more consistent. And you get to keep all the cards you get in the draft! Alas, this leads to another problem: most of the cards in the draft are common, so you can\\'t possibly explore all the mechanics the game has to offer.\\n***\\nEverything else in the game (art and visuals, sound, single player campaign, card design) is really well done, but inconsistent draws and aggro decks ruin all the fun.\\nP.S. On top of RNG draws, this game has some really counter intuitive interactions. For instance, when you attack and the opponent blocks your creatures with his creatures, you can cast fast spells. So, when you kill one of the blockers with a fast spell (so your blocked creature can attack face), your creature simply doesn\\'t attack at all but becomes exhausted (meaning it also can\\'t block enemy creatures this turn)!\\nAnother weird interaction is when the opponent blocks your non-flying creature with his non-flying creature and you give your creature \"fly this turn\" via fast spell, his creature is still able to block your creature even though non-flying creatures can\\'t block flying ones.\\nWhat\\'s the point of fast spells if you can\\'t surprise your opponent or bait him into blocking/attacking and then ruin his strategy with a spell?',\n",

The game happens in real time so if you don't hurry your family members can die, said time limit isn't that restrictive though and escorting your family members is actually not bad because they're competent enough at following you and enemies will gun for you most of the time. The castle rooms are randomly generated to an extent mainly when it comes to spawns for items, family members, and enemies. There is no map, but its not that confusing to navigate. Enemies tend to respawn once in a while next to doors, which is kind of cheap at first, but it becomes pretty predictable so you can prepare yourself.\\nThe funny thing is that your basic fists are actually really effective at killing non-vampire enemies because you just stunlock them so the game essentially turns into Phantom Blood: The Game and its quite fun. Turning water into holy water with your crucifix is a cool mechanic too and the holy water chalice just destroys almost anything in the game. The game does have really good atmosphere, really selling this early horror film aesthetic. Writing is not really anything to write home about, it’s just serviceable.\\nNosferatu is a good game to play for the Halloween season and I want a spiritual successor considering that this game will probably never get the HD remaster it deserves.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Released last year by Funcom, The Park is one of those walking simulators where you do not have enemies who can kill you, you do not have levels to complete and you do not have a boss battle at the very end of your story. However, you do have an interesting storyline with psychological and supernatural elements.\\nYou walk around in an amusement park controlling Lorraine who wishes to find her son. Callum has just run inside for no apparent reason - Lorraine is getting more and more desperate as night falls quickly and she begins experiencing one hallucination after the other. This creepy, dark and haunting environment is superbly brought to life thanks to the latest iteration of the Unreal engine. Lorraine's voice acting is also great and it accompanies the story very well.\\nSince this is a walking simulator you should not expect it to last longer than 2 hours. This is common and perhaps represents the only downside of the game. But then again this is common in this genre - you do not have many items you can interact with (mainly notes); they all help you understand the story (not just Lorraine's but that of the fun park).\\nIf you like the genre you'll probably enjoy the ride - as for rides: Lorraine has the possibility to try almost all carnival rides. These are perhaps the most unsettling parts of the game and are there to shed light on the background of the story. Whilst a bit too short and pricey (even with 50% discount) The Park represents a great adventure that can certainly be very entertaining.\",\n",

The third and fourth mission were very puzzly. You needed to use certain ghosts in certain situations or you wouldn\\'t be able to progress.\\nI completed the third mission a little bit aggrevated because you needed to guide people to certain locations which was a chore. The mission after that was straight up \"use this ghost in this situation to trigger this event, then use another ghost to do this and that\".\\nI wish they just kept it to scaring people and didn\\'t make you solve puzzles. There is depth in just scaring people since certain people are scared of certain things.\\nI wouldn\\'t recommend it if you\\'re not into the puzzles. Still, it\\'s quite an unique game and I might persevere to see if things change.\\nEDIT: I made it to the final mission before I became too frustrated to continue. As expected, most of the later missions are puzzle based and can be quite frustrating without a guide (in some cases even with a guide). The final mission is completely bonkers, in a bad way. You\\'re reliant on luck for a correct scenario to occur and you pretty much need a certain secret ghost to complete it.\\nIf you do pick this up, I would recommend using a guide if you\\'re feeling frustated.\\nUnfortunately even with a guide I was able to get stuck in a mission because I didn\\'t have the proper ghost power to proceed. My only options were to go replay a previous mission and unlock a secret ghost that had that ghost power or go buy it for one of my existing ghosts (which wasn\\'t an option as I already spent my coin for powers on other ghosts). I ended up editing my game with a save game editor to get that power.\\nThis game was an unique experience. Gameplay mechanics were great, the strong focus on puzzles was a letdown.',\n",

And at it\\'s best, it is really exciting to be discovering solutions, finding patterns and seeing how many creative things can be done with a simple concept. Even without any story or real motivation, apart from this sense of discovery.\\nAnd then the game decides to be \"challenging\", by gradually becoming tedious, annoying, frustrating, unbearable and at times outright sickening. It thinks of a nice (but potentially difficult for more tone-death people) idea of using sound as a hint for a solution. And then discards the idea almost immediatelly. But at the same time ponders around a ridiculously tiring idea of \"find the exact pixel perfect and timed solution in a room\" for about 30 puzzles. It thinks of a nice concept of using the shape you draw as the solution, to use it very few times in a game and instead - have some epilepsy inducing puzzles that will make your eyes bleed.\\nIt\\'s all about this idea of seeing shapes and symbols in your surroundings, but so many of these shapes are easy to notice, but a real b*tch to actually complete just because they tend to be pixel perfect. And because despite clear physical presense, your playable avatar cannot move their head slightly to the side or up or down.\\nIt has a \"challenge\" area that is just timed random puzzle stuff and the \"challenge\" being that not only this is timed, but the puzzels are actually random, to the point where they are not necesserily completable. And it \"rewards\" you for \"completing\" the game by reseting your progress and dumping you back at the start (the saves are not deleted). As if forgetting that vast majority of the stuff it asks of you has one or extremely limited solution possibility so there\\'s absolutely no fun at all in replaying it again (since you\\'re not discovering anything anymore).\\nThe Witness is such a sad huge waste of amazing potential, with it\\'s fantastic concept, amazing looks and tight art design. But implemented in such a way that it all just falls apart rather quickly. And I\\'d say that at least there\\'s nothing that mixes the magic of exploration, wonder and puzzles better, except there is. Called Antichamber and available for quite a while.\\nI am glad I experienced The Witness. And I do not plan to revisit it ever again.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Zombie Defense Review - Raymond KT\\nSummary: Today, 7 billion humans live on our planet. Over 100 billion lived and died on it in the past. What if just a tenth of them came back... for us? A modern hybrid of the classic RTS and modern Tower Defense. Recruit soldiers, place them on slots and let them shoot incoming waves of zombies by their own. Manually move soldiers between slots, upgrade slots and soldiers, order supplies, throw grenades and molotovs, order airstrikes and operate huge bulldozers. Perfect mix of strategy, tactics and micromanagement. Earn money on missions and spend them between missions to buy permanent technologies, upgrades, weapons ect.\\nThe game reminded me of “Yet another Zombie Defense” which is worth checking out if you didn’t. Zombie defense is a fun little game that is easy to pick up and put down. It's not tactical in the least but works fine as a zombie-themed tower defense game. It was worth the download for me and whil it has microtransactions, they don't feel at all necessary to proceed. I guess they could decrease some grindy elements but I never really felt an impulse to try any of them out.\",\n",

The puzzles are not frustrating, but they will tax your observational skill.
